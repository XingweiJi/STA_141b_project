# STA_141b_project
This is the repo for STA 141B class .   
We are going to use Yelp API to get our data and do some analysis on it. 

Dataset:
* business.json: Contains business data including location data, attributes, and categories.  
* review.json: Contains full review text data including the user_id that wrote the review and the business_id the review is written for.  
* user.json：User data including the user's friend mapping and all the metadata associated with the user.
* checkin.json：Checkins on a business.
* tip.json：Tips written by a user on a business. Tips are shorter than reviews and tend to convey quick suggestions.

# Temporary outline:
1. Do EDA(exploratary anaylysis on each dataset
2. See if we can find the relaitonship between dataset based on the analysis. 
3. determine the goal of the overall analysis.
4. machine learning to predict.
