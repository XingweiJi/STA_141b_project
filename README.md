# Yelp EDA and Machine Learning
We are going to use Yelp API to get our data and do some analysis on it. 

Dataset:
* business.json: Contains business data including location data, attributes, and categories.  
* review.json: Contains full review text data including the user_id that wrote the review and the business_id the review is written for.  
* user.json：User data including the user's friend mapping and all the metadata associated with the user.
* checkin.json：Checkins on a business.
* tip.json：Tips written by a user on a business. Tips are shorter than reviews and tend to convey quick suggestions.


Have you ever be fooled by a five stars restaurant or surprise by a one star restaurant on Yelp? If yes, here we are. Our mission is to fix the "inappropriate star" that the user gives to the restaurant which has a huge impact on business' overall rating.
