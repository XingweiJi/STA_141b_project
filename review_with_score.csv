I have a huge problem with paying MORE for way less food. The last time I went there I had the Pork Pad se Ew and it tasted good, but I finished my plate and was still hungry. I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a ""Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke & pad thai or pad se ew?"" Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money.

 I was referred here by a friend and at first thought ""Korean and Mexican?? WEIRD... i dont know""... but my husband and I were in the area and thought why not, lets try it... after my friend had nothing but great things to say about this place. We tried the chimichanga and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.... We actually did 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef (have you EVER been to a place that will make a burrito half and half? i havent!) The meat has fantastic flavor. I'm not a beef girl but i'd order a whole plate of their beef - its that good. The chimichanga was HUGE enough for both of us to share it (and my husband also had a beef taco which also was delicious) and we were FULL and it was $11 total with drinks. YOu cant beat that.

THe service was great. The server was so nice and attentive- you could tell she was the owner. 

The only thing I'd change is their chips they serve. They were burnt, too thick and kind of bland but their salsa is great. And lets face it, i'm fat so I we ate two baskets anyway so they cant be that bad. lol

Place was clean, server prompt, nice. Salmon was dry, overcooked. Walnut and tempura shrimp were good but warm/cool, not hot. Liked the tofu and veggies. Fried prawns were tasty. Crab legs? Crab legs, nothing spectacular. The fried rice? Hardened, couldn't pay me to eat it. All the meat dishes, with the exception of almost well done prime rib (not happy that there was no one at the carving station to cut or anyone to call and ask) had an after taste of cough medicine - so did the tapioca, but cake was ok.

I like that we no longer have to order and pay at the counter. We usually order calamari or calamari salad, katsu don.  This time the calamari was crispy but bland, the dipping sauce - no, thank you: tasted like mix of wasabi, tartar, and soap. Soy sauce saved the calamari.

Katsu don was super delicious and fresh. I was starving, finished mine and then went into a food coma. 

Staff was pleasant but the lower score is because: the place wasn't super busy (3 other tables, small parties 2-3 per table), and yet when we got there, our table was dirty - wiped away grease streak, 2 pcs of food laying on the table.

Liked that the screen is easier to read. Nice printed menus too. Purchased a Groupon  (4 burgers 4 sides) gave our orders (one burger and side to go) and was charged $26 and change. I'll take credit for signing and paying albeit confused, my mistake. Apparently lady assumed I only purchased a Groupon for (2 burgers and 2 sides). I pointed that out, she (lady 1) needed help and the lady (lady 2) who helped only asked the cash registrar for an explanation, not me. No sorry no nothing. Immediate refund of $21 no questions asked. I asked why it was only $21 not $26 and change, a brief and now obviously fake glance at the screen and I was told registrar was right not me. Lady 2 walks to the back and cancels 2 burgers and 2 sides. I patiently wait cause I understood the kitchen was busy and there was a line. I explained we needed 4 burgers and 4 fries again, no apologies for their own confusion and mistakes. Lady 2 just says the whole order needs to be cancelled and redone, again no apologies, didn't even offer to help further, just stayed in the kitchen. Lady 1 put in an order for the other 2 burgers and 2 fries (one to go) offered me 2 free drinks which I declined.

Guess what came to our table. Yep, 2 burgers and 2 fries (you know, the one pair that was to go). Explained to the server that we ordered 4, again no apologies, checks with the lady 1 at the register and shortly brings our order to us. Fries tasted like fries anywhere else, crispy, plain. Nothing special like before. Burgers were bland, both my husband and son said burgers were 'ok, not really tasty like last time.'

As we're eating, I notice lady 2 walking and chatting to other patrons. She stop by our table to make amends? Why of course not. She looked at us though, and walked away.

Last week I told my sisters to eat here. Just sent a message on group chat telling them not to waste their time. Few weeks ago told my coworkers to stop by here when they're in the neighborhood, I'll tell them about this visit on Monday.

Excuse my husband for being tired, human and saying the wrong drink name, 'frappe' instead of coolata being that he was exhausted and needed a pick me up. Apparently that is a personal offense to the Dunkin team. Instead of saying they serve 'coolatas' they server and his shift leader told my husband to go to Starbucks. I hope the franchise owner reads this so they know customers are being told to go across the street.  And btw, 'shift leader,' 'frappes' are at McDonalds.

Jon seems to be a friendly person, except that in the beginning he tried to deny a Yelp deal that we purchased, as he claimed the deal is for family photos only, which was NOT said in the deal description when we purchased. Anyhow he accepted the deal we bought eventually. However, it turned out to be a terrible experience.  

First of all, his studio is in his house, or maybe more specifically, in his garage. Certainly it is not fun to take a one-hour-photo-shoot at such a place when the temperature is over 100 outside and there is limited air-conditioning in the garage. He had to use a fan trying to make it cooler. But most importantly, his technique is not very impressive at all.  My green dress turned out to be blue in my photos! The skin tone of my face in the pictures turned out to be uneven, despite the fact I was put on make-up by professional beauty artist. Also, his so-called touch-ups of the pictures are awful, that he didn't even try to take the shines on my face away! --- As a matter of fact, I don't think those pictures we purchased have been touched up at all!  

I am not sure if he is good at taking family pictures as other claimed in the reviews, but if you go for professional head-shots, I won't recommend him at all. It will be a total waste of your money and time!",9,AYYKxiTdfsPIOBo3MqfAUg,-0.4000000059604645

Reason being, this isn't their first restaurant opening. Globe has two other locations, so it's owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant. But rather than focus on the facts that it smelled like a construction site, the floors and walls needed some minor finishing work, the staff were wandering about looking slightly confused and a little scared, and the place generally seemed like it probably wasn't ready to open just yet, I'm going to put all that aside and focus on the rest of Globe.

Globe's focus is on local stuff; that means they try to only serve products that are made close-to-home. Trouble is, I'm not exactly sure how far that close-to-home boundary extends to. I was told that it includes Ontario as a whole, but it could also go much further East or West; their Albacore tuna, for example, comes from BC and their mussels come from PEI. Other items don't explicitly explain where they come from, like the Cornish hen. That's the difficulty with going local though; right-off-the-bat you need to firmly establish your local boundaries. BC and PEI, after all, aren't right around the corner. Why not Maine lobster? Maine is a lot closer and seems a lot more local to me than anywhere in BC.

I suppose my beef here is that if you want to focus on locally produced stuff, then why not do it right down to the last detail? Why have a couple of wines from Italy and the US when you could easily make a wine menu completely from Niagara Peninsula wines or even from West Coast British Columbia (since we haven't yet established where that local line is drawn). I suppose the entire local concept is pretty hot right now, considering the whole farm-to-table trend, but those places are a bit more sincere by growing and sourcing everything onsite. To me, that's what true local eating is all about: setting firm boundaries.

The main thing that caught me right away-even more so than the local-ness of stuff-was the truly reasonable prices. At my initial walk-in to the beautiful dining room, I expected to pay a bit more, but that wasn't the case at all. Starters are around 11 bucks, entrees are around 22; at prices like that, it's even kind of refreshing, considering how elegant both the dining room and bar spaces are. And the food is good too. The local carnivore flatbread, for example, had a perfectly cooked flatbread base with some delicious, good-quality meats. The baked Spring vegetable tart seemed a little strange served on raw spinach, but the contrast worked nicely together.

The dining room space is beautiful. 20 foot ceilings, elegant lighting, solid wooden tables. In terms of sheer ambience and sophistication, there's nothing in Bloor West Village that can even come close to competing with Globe.

Despite the wandering servers, we were lucky enough to have the only one that seemed focused. Even though the meddling manager kept needlessly hovering over us mere seconds each time before our server got there, we had fantastic service that pretty much made the entire experience better. If we had another server, I probably would have thought a lot less.

Truth be told, Globe's focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion. However despite that, it was a pretty good overall experience, opening jitters and stage fright aside. I think that once they work all the kinks out, there'll be nothing in Bloor West Village-an area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin with-that can even come close to competing with Globe.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.10000000149011612

I dug the concept: tapas with a twist. This is definitely not your traditional, Spanish tapas. At Origin, you'll sample small plates with Asian, Italian and Latin influences. I didn't find the menu overwhelming, but our server was more than happy to help steer the meal so that similar and complimentary flavours were eaten together.

It was tough to narrow it down, as we would have been happy with just about anything on the menu. We started with the tostones: smashed, flattened and deep-fried plantains with guacamole on the side. The plantains were very well seasoned, with generous use of kosher salt and a light dusting of curry powder.

Next up were the deviled eggs with smoked bacon and gremolata and the smoked cod croquettes with saffron aioli. Both were a big hit at the table, disappearing in a flash. I preferred the croquettes of the two, but I didn't exactly NOT eat my share of the deviled eggs either.

Those scrumptious bites devoured, we ordered another bottle of wine (three cheers for Monday night dinners with lots of wine!) and anticipated the arrival of more delectable plates. While we waited, we marveled at the strangeness of the cutlery provided. The only way to balance your knife was blade up. That seemed...dangerous. Especially after the third glass of cabernet sauvignon.

Our next dish appeared and we dove right back in (carefully, so as not to cut ourselves on our upturned knives). A gorgeously-presented order from the Mozzarella Bar: bufala mozzarella with pear, rosemary oil, pine nuts that was drizzled with honey and placed on a crunchy, toasted slice of calabrese bread.

Next up was the Bangkok beef salad with peanuts, mint, mango, fried shallots and a sweet and sour dressing. There was a moment of hesitation while we all tried to dance around the fact that splitting this thing among the three of us might get violent. In the end however, we shared well (our kindergarten teachers would be so proud!). This wasn't an exceptionally complicated dish, but it was done to perfection: the beef was tender and pink; the mangoes were ripe and slippery; the shallots and peanuts added the crunch the dish needed; and the cilantro added the wonderful, bright note at the end. It should be noted that my friend said it was the third time she'd had this particular dish, and it was exactly the same every time. THAT is a sign of a great restaurant.

Our final round of food was to arrive, and we were practically giddy with excitement. We had decided on the Chinois duck with pickled cucumber, hoisin and sriracha sauce on a chive pancake, the curried shrimp with naan and the miso-glazed black cod with soba noodles and a ginger vinaigrette. We knew each dish would be good, but didn't know HOW good. We had spent the first half of the meal happily eating away and we were by no means disappointed with our choices. But these last three dishes absolutely blew them all out of the water. The duck was crispy and, I must say, substantial. The kitchen does not scrimp on the portions at all with this dish! The sweet hoisin sauce was a great compliment to the duck and the heat of the sriracha. A definite must-order at Origin.

Next up, we attacked the curried shrimp, which was intensely flavoured and perfectly spicy. The soft, aromatic naan bread sopped up the spicy broth that was left after devouring the plump, juicy shrimp. Another dish that hit its mark!

Finally (and kind of sadly), we came to our last dish: the black cod. Black cod is one my favourite fish and I have it a fair bit. When I was out in Vancouver earlier this year, I had it almost once a day. but this black cod might be the best I've had...ever. It was flaky, tender and moist. The miso glaze was pleasantly salty and the skin, most importantly, was nice and crispy. The soba noodles were served with the ginger vinaigrette and by the time we were done, there was literally nothing left on the plate. In all likelihood, the best dish of the night though the three of us never could decide on a clear winner in that category.

All in all, I would definitely recommend Origin to anyone who has some reasonably adventurous taste buds and who is willing to share. There is one composed plate that makes a meal - a burger combo with Spanish fries and a float. I have no doubt it's delicious, but it seems kind of beside the point of a restaurant like this. Go with friends, go on a date, go with family. It's not a cheap night out, but it is most definitely money well spent.",4,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

Or, in this case, a bar by its' signage. Let's face it, I'm a sucker for good signage. And Souz Dal has it. The rusty globe hangs outside like a relic, the name of the bar cut into the side. Lit, and glowingfrom within, it reminds me of one of those tin punch-out crafts made from a (insert random legume) canat summer camp. But much cooler of course. It was this sign that caught my attention on more than one occasion, beckoning me in when I had somewhere else to be. Finally, one night a couple of weeks ago, I gave in to its sirens call. I was a little bit disappointed.

It was devoid of people save for us and the lonely bartender. I say lonely, butjudging by his charm (see: none) he probably liked it better thatway. Granted though, it was early - Souz Dal only has a drink menu - and a few more folk trickled in as the night wore on.

The stars I gave are attributed solelyto the bar's ambience. Dimly lit, and painted in muted reds and oranges it has an earthy orMoorish feel to it. Worn textiles and cathedral mirrors adorn the walls, while candles flicker on every table, casting shadows. The back patio has a similar vibe happening, cloistered in by high walls, andlit by candles wedged in the mouths of old wine bottles.

Now I rarely turn down a good patio, but in this case I chose aseat inside, which says a lot.Reclined on velvet benches at our table by the open front window, we watched College Street come alive as we perused the drink menu. I was in a cocktail mood, and my friend had read somewhere that Souz Dal claimed to have the ""best"" mojitos in the city, so that was the first order I placed. 

Now I've been to Cuba. I did a little backpacking, starting in Havanaand makingmy way to the South coast. I wouldn't say I'm a connoiseur of the mojito because of this, but I diddrink my fair share, and like to think I know a thing or two about a good one. And this wasn't one of them. There wasn't nearly enough mint or sugar, so it was overwhelmingly bitter. I don't like my mojitos to taste like Kool-Aid, but I do like a little sweetness to curb the edge. 

Unlikely to order another of the same, but unwilling to give up on the bar, we tried a few other beverages. Nothing wowed us. The Moscow Mule with its ginger beer offered a nice slow burn, but it also wasn't a repeat offender. The fortune cookie garnish on the lychee-infused Soho martini was fun, but not nearly as tasty as a lychee would have been. 

Although funky signage and ambience mean a lot to me, a good drink means even more, so chancesare Iwon't be returning to Souz Dal. If however, you are in the market for an intimate date setting (see: empty bar) then head on over. And if a mediocre mojito is your thing, then you can get them herefor $5.75 on Mondays.",0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.0

An unassuming neighbourhood favourite for years, Mazz Sushi has been one of the few sushi options for Bloorcourt and Bloordale residents. Each time I visit, I am amazed by how bustling a place it is with the constant turning of tables and the rapid fire filling of take-out bags.

On a recent weeknight excursion, the small dining room was full, with a great mix of students, parents with young children and older couples; a typical audience for Mazz. Soon the servers were trying to accommodate extra guests and pointing out that it would be a '10 to 15 minute wait' for a table.

Seated, with menus in hand, the server soon appeared with the tea that was barely just ordered. Mazz's tea is very earthy in flavour with a hint of barley. Moving on quickly to another table, he left us to continue to ponder the menus, not returning for quite some time.

Upon his return, we quickly placed our order for various maki and sashimi hoping that the busyness of the place wouldn't slow the normally lightning-quick service.

After a moment, he returned with a bowl of congee and an amuse-bouche of marinated tofu. Don't be alarmed, these are Mazz's welcome dishes. I find the tofu pleasant enough, but the congee seems a little too heavy and porridge-like to start a meal.

Before these two were done, he was back again with the ubiquitous Miso soup and house salad. The soup was seasoned and flavourful with lots of nori and tofu. The salad was a small mixture of iceberg lettuce with some vegetable shavings and slices: by the book, but not out of this world.

Just as we were finishing our appetizers, the first of our rolls arrived. We ordered a Spicy Tuna maki: tuna mixed with crumbled tempura and hot sauce. My guest, not a fan of spicy food, likes Mazz's version, as she doesn't normally find it too spicy. Unfortunately this time they were a little too spicy for her. Good for me, but bad for her. A minor thing, but consistency means repeat business.

Next, the rest of our food arrived: a sashimi dinner and Dynamite roll. The sashimi dinner is always a joy at Mazz, and this time was no different. The plate usually contains a nice selection of tuna, white tuna, salmon and possibly mackerel, and always has more pieces then advertised. This time was no different, and the fish was very fresh. The only complaint, and I've found this happens quite regularly in Toronto, is that the white tuna was served too cold. The Dynamite roll was large, but a little tasteless; seemingly prepared in too much of a hurry, a couple of pieces unraveled and fell apart on the plate.

Overall, Mazz Sushi let us down a little on this visit. The staff seemed rushed and unable to provide the consistency that we have come to expect. Not once during our meal were we offered more tea, a slight unheard-of in a sushi restaurant. The food, although served quickly, wasn't up to their usual standards, and the wait to order was long. And although it remains quite inexpensive, the discount on the receipt for paying with cash seems to have disappeared with the updating of cash register system.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.10000000149011612

Sure, I know the breakfast is only 3 dollars, so I probably shouldn't be hard on it; but regardless of price, I'd still like my meal to be served hot and be put together with some level of care and attention.

This is a pretty mediocre breakfast here: a slice of warm ham, a strip of old bacon, browned toast, over/undercooked eggs, leftover potatoes, breakfast served here is less-than-spectacular, and the service staff doesn't seem to care if you complain about it; I'm sure they've heard it all countless times before.

All of this, of course, is served in one Toronto's prized possessions, High Park. If it wasn't for the location, I certainly would have given them 1 star. In fact, it wasn't for the location, I probably wouldn't have eaten there at all. And in some strange way, I almost wish I didn't eat there.

Uncle Betty's has only been open for a few months, but it already seems to have garnered a dedicated following. We went to Uncle Betty's on a bustling Friday night, looking for a casual meal and easy going atmosphere; Uncle Betty's certainly provided both. Painted in bright blue and cheery orange, lots of seating inside, and a small patio off the front, we felt right at home. Several families were enjoying meals with their kids in tow As the evening wore on though, most of those families were replaced with twenty and thirty-somethings looking for a cool place to hang out.

Offering sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, and many other of Uncle Betty's specialty creations, the menu is fairly extensive and varied. We ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich with a salad, and the grilled cheese sandwich, which was made with homemade mac-and-cheese and meatloaf stuffed inside. Their grilled cheese also comes in a pulled pork variety, which I am sure we will try on our next outing. Both meals were great, the vegetable sandwich was warm, the cheese was nicely melted, and the bread was crisp. The grilled cheeses sandwich was deemed as one of the ""best ever,"" however, the portion size was on the small side for a $15 sandwich. Both of us agreed that the sandwich could be a little bigger, but overall we were impressed with the quality and creative effort put into the food. 

For dessert, we each tried a Dreesen's cinnamon sugar doughnut, made fresh on site, and although they were pretty tasty, I am setting my sights on the ice cream bar next time. It is far too bright and colourful to miss, with jars of candy toppings and a great selection of ice cream flavours to choose from.

The service was friendly and attentive, and we had a conversation with the owner, Samara Melanson, as we were leaving. Samara and her husband recently opened the restaurant, and it's always great to meet the owner while dining out and learn about the creation of the restaurant and where some of the ideas for the food come from. She told us that chef Paul Lampa was brought over from Coquine restaurant, which explains the ""gourmet"" comfort food bent and the locally sourced ingredients. 

Most appetizers are priced from 6 - 10 dollars; entrees varied in price from about 9 - 15 dollars, and wine and beer was in the 6 - 8 range. And Uncle Betty's carries Kicking Horse coffee, which is an instant sell and a welcome find for this Toronto-transplanted Western girl. 

Betty's also offers what looks to be a delicious weekend brunch, with homestyle blueberry pancake and Uncle Betty's own take on eggs benny, which comes served on a doughnut.  We will definitely be back to Uncle Betty's to try some of the other great entrees on the menu, and  of course to dig into their ice cream bar.",3,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.6000000238418579

A friend used to live there many moons ago, but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer. In recent years, however, the lure of the restaurants lining Roncesvalles Ave has drawn me to the West side of the city more frequently. I never know quite what to expect when I arrive, but I am always pleasantly surprised.

One such surprise awaited me at The Ace. I had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages; even that it had once been a Chinese restaurant. Now headed up by chef Peter McKnight, it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food: fried chicken, burgers, soup, Shepherd's pie. While the menu has changed, the décor most certainly did not; the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950's feel.
My friend and I settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen. When asked what we'd like to drink, I tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight. Well, no taps that I recognized anyway. Our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps.  A great aesthetic touch behind the bar.

We submitted our drink orders - Mill St. for me, the Ace Manhattan for my friend - and took stock of the menu.  Written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose. We pondered several options, but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a ""Christmas burger"" the whole plan changed. Ground turkey with stuffing in the middle, topped with cranberry chutney? THIS had to be eaten. As delicious as it sounded, it was actually better than anticipated.  It hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes. 

Also sampled were the deep-fried Brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous, briny oysters. Both were truly excellent and personified what The Ace is all about: simple food done perfectly. My dining companion and I nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the Brussels sprouts, something I truly thought would never, ever happen in my lifetime. 

If you're at The Ace, do not miss the fried chicken, which is succulent, juicy and crispy, served with him gravy, collard greens and cornbread (though why the cornbread is served on the gravy is a bit beyond me, as it has the unfortunate effect of making the bread a big soggy after a while). The fresh pasta with tuna, chiles, plum tomatoes and basil was cooked to exactly al dente and the flaked trout with potatoes, radishes and red onions struck a great balance of temperature, texture and flavor. 
No matter how full you may be from the well-sized  portions, I implore you not to skip dessert. The ice cream in particular is outstanding. Do not miss the oatmeal, stout or chocolate-rosemary concoctions: they are all made in-house and I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for an entire vat of the chocolate-rosemary ice cream to take home so that I could swim in it. Seriously. Do not miss dessert!

By the time we left around 8pm, The Ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable, homey environment with excellent comfort food, attentive staff and a great bartender. I would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.  Go early or go late or go for brunch. You won't be disappointed.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

A former Burger King at Bathurst and Bloor has become the second Toronto location for the Vancouver dynamo chain. It's easy enough to almost walk past Guu Sakabar--nicknamed Guu 2--as you travel down Bloor Street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows. Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.

Inside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...

This restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.

With that in mind, this has to be one of the most well-trained service and kitchen staff I've ever come across. I went to Guu 2 on a Tuesday evening, and it was jam-packed. Between seating guests, taking orders, delivering orders, cooking, clearing and processing payments, I have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers. Guu has raised the bar for what I believe a well-working service staff is capable of. I will say that a couple of our orders that I consider starters, like salads and sashimi, came out last, but the dishes are small, and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters. The organization and teamwork is impeccable; we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once, a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us. It seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing. Awesome.

Well to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.

A variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a soufflé of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.

One benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.

Quite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it. You may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it.",5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.4000000059604645

Every couple of years some new ingredient or dish seems to capture the attention of cooks everywhere. Someone does it well, and then soon niche restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere.

A number of years ago, it was the burrito, soon the poutine became chic.
Lately it seems like everyone needs to prove they have the best Southern-style barbeque.

On a recent Saturday night, I had the opportunity to eat at Lou Dawg's; Southern Sandwiches at King and Portland in the Entertainment District. Nestled in the basement, Lou Dawg's seems to be punching above its weight. It has a fairly small front of house, and on this night, a third of that front of house seemed to be taken up by an impromptu stage while the sound and light guys were setting up. And once they did, it was loud! Not only that, it wasn't even music. The sound system was blaring an audio feed from the football game projected on the large screen on the opposite wall. Despite that, the place was buzzing. Pretty much all the tables were full and the young-ish crowd that was there seemed to be happy enough, with tables full of plates and pints.

With our large order placed at the bar, we watched a group clear out and quickly snagged the table. No sooner did he drop off our pints did our food arrive. It was super quick, and it couldn't have been more than five minutes. My guests and I ordered the gamut of the menu: pulled chicken, beef brisket, and pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad, coleslaw and a 'Loutine' (poutine with pulled pork). Everything looked great...

The pulled pork had a pleasant smoky flavour and was quite juicy and moist, but after a couple of bites it seemed to be very one note; there wasn't that nice tang you get with true southern barbeque. The pulled chicken was very dry. This is a dish most people have difficulty doing well, and I don't think Lou Dawg's is any different. It seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile... waiting for someone to order it... The beef brisket was popping with flavour. It was succulent, with just the right amount of fattiness. If you're there, I highly recommend it.

Side dishes is where Lou Dawg's really shines. Their coleslaw is creamy, sweet and crisp, with dried cranberries and raisins. And the potato salad? Truly made with love. It burst with flavours of dill and mustard seed, and the potatoes were cooked to the perfect texture.

The small poutine was quite a large portion. The fries were as they should be: crisp and fresh tasting with a hefty salting. If the cheese was curds, you couldn't tell. They had lost all of their consistency from over heating. The chicken gravy was way too salty and overpowered the mild flavour on the pulled pork.

Overall, Lou Dawg's didn't live up to the hype. I've had better Southern barbeque at places that don't specialize in it, and way better at places that do. Coupled with that, the restaurant seemed a little unsure of itself. Is it trying to be a restaurant? a sports bar? or a neighbourhood performance space? or just a hangout for friends of the staff? This indecision usually sounds the death knell of any place. So while the sides and brisket made it a place worth returning to, there wasn't much keeping me from going somewhere else.",8,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.10000000149011612

Well, it was until The Mugshot Tavern opened anyways... The Mugshot easily provides the perfect answer to filling that void, and then some. Truly nice owners, delicious food, and a killer environment, this place takes the neighbourhood bar way beyond what it's expected to be.

If the Mugshot doesn't have the best draft selection in a 10 km radius, it certainly has the most well-thought-out one. These guys obviously love beer, and more obviously is that they've put a ton of thought into what is being pulled from the taps. It's all craft beer, and some interesting stuff at that. Chances are they have a few you've never even heard of, like the King Pilsner and Warthog Ale. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that they're probably one of only a handful of places in the city with either on tap. Don't expect to find Canadian or Blue here; what they offer is much more creative than any of that stuff.

The food, and the entire menu for that matter, is equally well-thought out. It's a killer mix of Southern-soul and comfort food, and they do a dam fine job of pulling it off. You can expect to find Southern favorites, like fried chicken with fritters, and some not so expected ones, like in-house-made corn dogs with chutney. The presentation is pretty decent too and again, goes beyond the typical bar stuff. It's pretty obvious that the people manning the kitchen know what the hell they're doing back there. Rarely do I go to a restaurant and have difficulty deciding what to order; at The Mugshot I was torn between a few items.

They've done a dam good job of ridding the place of all remnants of the defunct McKenzies that used to take up the place. They've clearly spent a lot of time, thought, and energy turning it into something completely new. The environment, painted in bright red and tactfully covered in old-school, famous mugshot photos, is easily the kind of space you could hang out for a long, long time. It's comfortable and welcoming, the way a neighbourhood local should be. Despite not being an overly large place, it still accommodates nicely, and any excess people can spill onto their cozy rooftop patio.

And the staff at Mugshot? They couldn't be any friendlier. Having only been open about a week or so, you'd never know it by their attitudes. Likely working long hours, round-the-clock, getting the place ready and established, they're still sociable, out-going, and friendly. I sure-as-hell didn't feel like a stranger in this joint, and I don't think anyone with even the teeniest bit of personality would either. Even coming in by yourself is sure to get you some conversation.

It's clear that, after just opening, they're still trying to establish their crowd. It's still sorta random as to the people that might be in there. While one day the bar could be full of seniors, that evening it could be packed with a younger crowd. It seems to be dependent on the time of day, but it's also, unfortunately, the way the neighbourhood seems to work. Customers are sorta like family; you can't really pick 'em.

The Mugshot isn't just the kind of place you sit, drink, and hide from the world, although it provides that pretty well; it's also the kind of place that you can unexpectedly get some truly imaginative and delicious food in a comfortable and welcoming space. In a neighbourhood like High Park, The Mugshot Tavern is unrivaled in every respect.",16,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

The uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'. Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.

We spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.

After a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon & smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.

When the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.

Between the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.

Amazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.

I would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).  If you haven't been, add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner!",0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.5

I have visited it on several occasions, and each time I leave, I debate whether sharing this place with the world is worth having to wait for a table during an already busy dinner rush. My conscience prevails, as 5 Doors North is too great of a restaurant not to review, and share with my fellow TOFoodReviews readers.

A spur of the moment, ""Thursday night out"" decision, led Andy and I to 5 Doors North, knowing we would get a great meal. We were seated in the front area of the dining room, perfect for people watching along the Eglinton-Davisville and Yonge street corridor. The furnishings are worn, kitschy, and mismatched, but only add to the warmth and charm of the restaurant.  The restaurant menu is hand-written and photocopied, followed by an evolving list of specials on the chalkboard, which are carefully selected, and always guaranteed to be great.

The wine list is small and filled with some robust reds. I ordered the Pinot Noir, which I have to say, just didn't do it for me, it was a bit thin and wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Andy's Malbec was fabulous, so we both ordered another glass for the second round. Wines by the glass are anywhere from $7 to $11, and bottles in the $30-$50 range. Overall, wines are priced fairly well, but I would love to see a little more variety to match the diverse food menu.

The appetizer list is long, and everything sounds incredible. They have smoked salmon, Prosciutto, mussels, a delicious polenta dish, on top of the list of daily specials, which included cauliflower soup, avocado bruschetta, and crab cakes. We went with the soup, beef Carpaccio with Pecorino cheese & roasted onion, and the beet salad. First out was the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli & lotus chips, which was wonderful, the goat cheese soft and warm, and the beets sweet and crunchy. The roasted cauliflower soup was smoky and creamy, but not too heavy; a perfect start to the meal, and the beef Carpaccio was some of the best, the cheese and onion offsetting the beef perfectly.

For our mains, I ordered the gnocchi Gorgonzola special and Andy the braised brisket ravioli. The meals were incredible. The gnocchi was awesome, fresh and soft, but the real winner was the Gorgonzola cream sauce. So creamy, it certainly blew my cheese calorie allotment for the week, but so worth it. Garnished with scallions and fresh pepper, the meal needed nothing more to bring out the strong flavours in the Gorgonzola.

The braised brisket ravioli was probably one of the more interesting meals we have ever had. I was unsure what to expect, but the beef was perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, wrapped in fresh pasta, with beef au jus and cream to make up the ravioli sauce. It would be worth phoning in advance to see if this was on the specials menu, as this dish just has to be tried.

The prices are right, entrées run from $14-$20, with appetizers in the $8-$12 range. The service is extremely friendly, with everyone pitching in to seat, serve and check-in. It's a family run restaurant, and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 Doors North as much as you will.",7,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.6000000238418579

While Bamburger offers a decent take-out menu, we chose to enjoy their small, but friendly sidewalk patio, right in the middle of restaurant row at Yonge and Davisville. Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed ""diner"" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.

Starting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.

The menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is ""Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50),"" and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!

We went with the ""Bambamburger ($11.50),"" which is 2/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the ""Bambamburger,"" and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.

Bamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.

If you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.",8,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.6000000238418579

Mr Greek has slid to becoming nothing more than a glorified cafeteria. That might actually be giving it more credit than it deserves though, because I've been to some cafeterias that aren't absolutely horrible.

I remember stopping in there in the past and having some pretty decent souvlaki, but what you're presented with now is nothing close to decent. The souvlaki is tough and tasteless, the rice is lukewarm and overcooked, the vegetables were likely previously frozen; bottom line is, this is in no way an accurate representation of what Greek food is in Toronto. Add in the sweaty, pushy serving staff, and you have an all around poor dining experience.

I actually complained via email last time I went, and I promptly received an email back from the owner full of profuse apologies and promises of a better meal, nicer service and an overall better experience if I returned. Although I appreciated his effort, the last thing I want is to be forced another meal there. I know restaurants can have a bad day, and I'm willing to overlook that. But from what I saw, this was just another day in the life of crappy restaurant living of it's achievements in the distant past.

Upon arrival we found that this is an odd spot on Queen West where a string of three of four Indian restaurants are all lined up side-by-side, so which to choose?

One thing I love about Toronto restaurants that you won't always find in smaller cities are menus posted on the outside of the building.  Little India stood out for it's well-organized, easy to understand and well-priced menu - in we went.

It is definitely an intimate spot, having no real capacity to hold very large groups, but was still quite comfortable for our dining duo. It was a cold Thursday night and not overly busy, so it did not feel crowded, and it gave the servers that much more time to be attentive.

The menu is substantial and has a variety of dishes. The price range is about $15 - $20 for an entrée, but be sure to ask which ones come with rice or Naan and which don't so that you can order them on the side.  First up was the mixed platter appetizer, which included samosas, onion bhajia, pakora and spring rolls. Everything was crispy, hot and just the right size for something before the entrée-and it came in at under $5.

For the main, I ordered the chicken kebab and my dinner partner had the Madras chicken.  Fair warning: if they tell you it's going to be hot, then it's truly hot.  We are all too accustomed to those Canadian-ized restaurants that tone down their spiciness to appease the masses, and it is arguable that Little India may do this too, but in any case, take the servers' recommendations to heart.  I do enjoy some heat, but my taste buds can't handle extremes, so I steered clear on this occasion-except for a little taste of the Madras.  For those of you who do like spice, you'll love this!  It has that heat that creeps up after a few bites, not that punch-in-the-face-burn that you might get from cheap chicken wings covered in Frank's Red Hot. Our server did lean my friend toward the less-spicy of the dishes she was deciding between at first, much to her dismay, but as it turns out his suggestion right on.  As for my tamer dish, it had more of a Mediterranean flavour to it; grilled, lemony and came with a cucumber salad garnished with cilantro.  It was a happy reminder of summer while dining in the depths of winter.

One of the greatest things about this restaurant is something I was not even able to take advantage of: the lunch buffet.  This is a bit of a hike from my own home and workplace, but for those of you in the area, I say go for it!  Buffets have a bit of a bad reputation (and for the most part it's well-deserved), but a small arrangement at a non-chain location like this can be a perfect opportunity to try a variety of what is on the menu, especially if it is food you're mostly unfamiliar with.

Overall, I can't leave you saying it was the very best Indian cuisine I've ever had, but I can say that I wasn't disappointed, and I would go back again-especially for that buffet.",3,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

At least that's what the button said that was given to me by the man behind the counter at Pancho's Bakery.  After noticing the small collection I have attached to both my bag and jacket, he was quick to give me a new addition.  I was hesitant to let it join the ranks, after all ""I heart"" anything is a pretty bold statement, and to be honest, as of that moment, I had never had a mind blowing churro experience, or at least one that would have me declaring such strong feelings for them.  The only time I ever ate a churro was at an establishment once promoted by a talking Chihuahua, so you can understand my hesitation.  I pocketed the button, as its fate would be determined later.

Pancho's Bakery makes up a portion of what is titled the Latin American Food Court in Kensington Market.  The tiny little storefront on Augusta Avenue is deceiving, as it houses more businesses than I would have guessed.  Assuming it was only Pancho's in the building, I was surprised (and excited) to see a stall selling tacos, another dealing in empanadas, and the infamous pop-up Agave y Aguacate.  Pancho's itself occupies the space right up front, across from the Korean dumpling stand... I'm not sure exactly how they fit in.  Apparently the Latin American Food Court doesn't discriminate, and why should they?  Dumplings are tasty, and well, I'm sure another vendor only helps pay the rent.

It was around twelve o'clock on a Friday when my friend and I decided to check out Pancho's. Neither of us had eaten, but we couldn't quite justify having churros for lunch. We are of the mindset however, that believes dinner shouldn't be the only meal followed by dessert, so our afternoon repast that day would have a churro chaser.

Full of carnitas tacos, and kimchi empanadas (Korean dumpling cart influence!), but not too full to pass up deep-fried dough, we made our way back to Pancho's.  I was promptly questioned as to the whereabouts of my button but I quickly placed my order as a distraction.

The churros at Pancho's are piped out in the front window, and brought to life for all too see, before quickly being led to their delicious demise in the deep fryer.  They are served hot, either plain or filled with your choice of chocolate, dulce de leche or strawberry syrup.  We ordered four, one of each flavour, and a plain.  At my servers recommendation I also grabbed some bread pudding and traditional Mexican concha bread.  As we had lost our seats (there aren't many to begin with) and the sun was shining, we took our treats to go.

We started with the chocolate, moved on to the dulce de leche, followed by the strawberry, and thus ended anticlimactically with the plain. They were crispy and sugar coated on the outside, while soft and (with the exception of the plain) accompanied with a burst of sweetness from within. Churro rookies be warned... a churro is a like a deep fried dough straw.  Any filling that goes in the top, will ultimately come out the bottom.  We left a sticky trail through the streets of Kensington that led back to Pancho's.  If Hansel and Gretel only knew about these, they would have rethought the breadcrumb idea.

Later at home, I popped the bread pudding and concha into the oven.  Concha is a sweet bread that resembles a clam shell, hence the name.  It tasted a little of brown sugar, but overall it was bland.  I think the idea however is to serve it alongside a cup of café con leche or hot chocolate and get to dunking.  I could see this working in its favour.

The bread pudding however (traditionally served around this time of year to be eaten for Lent) was delicious.  Dense, but very moist, and just sweet enough, my girlfriend went nuts over it. Apparently she doesn't have a problem with dessert after other meals either - and this time it was breakfast.

Now I'm not a fan of donuts, and the churro is essentially the donuts Spanish cousin, but I would take a Pancho's churro over a donut any day, and these are what I will return for.  As it turns out, I really do ""heart"" churros after all.  Now where did I put that button?",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.0

First impressions were that this restaurant is HUGE. It's a good spot if you are looking to throw a large-group party or corporate event dinner. They definitely have room to accommodate large groups for dinner and drinks.

The menu is set up with shareable appetizers as well as traditional entrees. We tried a variety of starters, all which ranged from $13.50 to $16.50.

First, we tried the Louisiana Shrimp Po Boys. This sharable serving came with three Po boy sliders, along with a helping of fries. The shrimp were lightly spiced instead of battered like a traditional po'boy sandwich, and were served with creole tartar sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. The buns were a bit oversized for the shrimp in the sandwiches. Something tells me they are better suited for the hamburger sliders also on the menu.

Next up for appetizers is the Charcuterie Flatbread. This was a great value! The flatbread that came to our table was the size of a small pizza. Each of us had a few pieces, which is a great size for an appetizer. As a big fan of a traditional charcuterie board I was interested in trying this out, and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was not overpowered by the cheese, tomato and sauce base on the flatbread. Would highly recommend this one!

Traditional entrees were next... I tried the Surf n Turf, a new menu item, which was $29. I really liked the unique presentation, which each item set up on a long board instead of a traditional steak and potatoes plate. The steak was cooked exactly as I requested. The lobster tail was a generous size, and the lemon-garlic butter sauce wasn't overpowering at all. It was cooked perfectly too and was very meaty.

Unfortunately, the double cheese baked potato was very dry. It seems like they are premade and had cheese, asparagus, and shallots added and reheated. A simply baked potato would have been a better choice for this one. The attempt at an added flair didn't add much to this dish.

Under recommendation from our waitress, we also tried the Penne Jambalaya. This huge helping of pasta came with big chunks of chorizo, chicken breast and shrimp, in a Sambucca Cajun cream sauce. The sauce tasted a lot like vodka sauce, for those who have never tried Sambucca before. The portion size was impressive, and the pasta had a good kick of spice to it too. Definitely a win, and at $19 it was well worth it.

Once 10pm hit, the music was turned up to a deafening level, and other tables of guests began to arrive, including a few party groups with bottle service for the night. We decided it was time to ask for dessert so we could head on our way. The Brownie Cookie Stack arrived at our table with fanfare. A huge firework candle drew the attention from the tables around us as it arrived. It would be great for a birthday party or function, but as a regular dessert accompaniment it was a little over the top. Again, we were pleasantly surprised by the portion size, a stack of 4 huge, thick brownie and chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream and raspberry drizzle, all for $10. Although the presentation was amazing, the ice cream and sauce just couldn't bring out enough from the cookies, which were warm but weren't very moist or chewy.

Overall, the food is comparable to a lot of nightclub-restaurants on King Street in Toronto but at a more affordable price range, and without the 60-minute wait for a table. The service was great, from the manager to the hostesses we felt very welcomed at the restaurant. &Company would be an awesome spot to celebrate your birthday, family function or company party but if you are looking for an intimate dinner party or a romantic evening, this might not be the best choice.",8,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

It's likely that you've heard of it, or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage. It's become somewhat of a Leslieville landmark.

First things first, I've heard a lot of negative comments about this place. By the sounds of it, it's one of those places that's hit-or-miss and completely different from one visit to the next; amazing one time, awful the next. Because I've never had dinner there, I can't vouch for evening dining, but I can say this: if you truly don't want run the risk of being disappointed, stick with their weekend brunch. This place is known for brunch. While they may have their issues, Joy Bistro has no problems delivering an upscale brunch experience that is chock full of style.

Brunch at Joy Bistro is not really bistro-ish. The brunch food here is mostly just what you'd expect to see on a brunch menu in most Toronto restaurants, but they do their brunch stuff particularly well. Eggs benny is served up in numerous styles like Benetine (with spinach and peameal bacon), Norwegien (with stacked smoked salmon), and Teddy (with peameal bacon, roasted tomatoes, and spinach). With their near-perfect hollandaise, eggs benny at Joy Bistro is a solid choice.

That, and they've got a killer patio. Intimate and relaxing, their patio is probably one of the best things about this place and the likely reason that a lot of people still frequent it even after having poor experiences. Leslieville has got a few patio spots, but for sheer space, warmth, and location sitting on a busy little Leslieville corner overlooking Jimmie Simpson Park, Joy Bistro's patio is in a league of its own. Worth the sit down in the summer.

They've recently undergone mass renos, which has resulted in Joy Bistro Bar. Although this may have helped the space modernize, it's also contributed to changing their clientele base. Neighbourhood locals that frequented Joy over the years seem to have gone looking for other spots while those looking for a more trendy experience seem to take over. I guess as Leslieville becomes more popular, Joy Bistro wants to change with the nighbourhood, and while change can be good, in most cases, if it isn't broke them why fix it?

Despite that new clientele, it's still a great place for brunch. So the next time a nice, summer weekend rolls around, head out to Joy Bistro for brunch on the patio. By the sounds of it though, I certainly wouldn't do anything but brunch.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

Maybe its the changing of the seasons, and I'm subconsciously trying to carbo-load for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation. Whatever it is, this past Monday I was looking for just that at Terroni on Queen West.
 
The camp is divided on Terroni. People either rave about it or complain about the pretentious servers, the 'no-substitution' rule, or the slice-it-yourself pizza. Being a fan of this place, I have a rebuttal for each of these complaints. 

While (some of) the servers may seem a bit curt at first, I owe this to the fact that Terroni is busy - always busy - and their no-nonsense attitude is often mistaken for pretentiousness. Our server, although brusque, took our order diligently while complementing our choices, had our wine to the table in no time, and managed to pour two glasses of the stuff from the awkwardly shaped porcelain decanter without dribbling it everywhere (which is something we later failed to do). 

As for the no-subsitutions rule, if you want to choose your own toppings, then head on down to that infamous sub-par pizza joint (you know the one...with its orange boxes and redundant title) and stuff your crust while you're at it. Since when did slicing pizza become a chore? Just a few simple back and forth motions with a knife and voila! Freshly sliced pizza.  
  
Regardless of the division, Terroni is always packed. Monday at 9:00 found us one free table upstairs, which was where our preference lay anyway. Although I do love to pull up to the bar, it tends to get a bit clustered on the lower level, and while the upstairs isn't exactly quiet, shouting across the table isn't required. 

Our waiter promptly brought us the menus and we poured over the apps and the twenty-nine - yes, twenty-nine - pizzas they have to offer.  

We started with the Funghi Assoluti ($12.95):  breaded and baked oyster mushrooms served on arugula, sprinkled with parmesan, and drizzled with a balsamic glaze.  It was superb, but sharing proved to be problematic, not because the portion wasn't large enough, but because we simply didn't want to. Social graces saved us, but I had visions of the two of us in an Animal Planet-esque showdown... circling the last mushroom with fangs bared and hackles raised. 
 
We chased all of this down with a velvety Piemonte that was oddly served in a jug, which made it difficult to pour. Our server made it look effortless, but us? Well, we just made a mess. I did manage to solve the problem however (pour from the side, and not from the oddly shaped lip) and fortunately for us we had a seemingly bottomless half litre.
 
No sooner had we finished sharing the last 'shroom was our pizza delivered to the table. We went with the Primavera ($15.95) to contribute to our daily recommended dose of veggies and to somehow convince ourselves that we were being healthy. All of the pizza at Terroni is thin crust and ours was weighed down heavily with tomatoes, red pepper, (more) mushrooms, and artichokes with a few black olives decorating the centre of the pie. 

Now when I say thin-crust, I mean it.  Maybe I'm just speaking for myself here, but I have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at Terroni. I'm a big fan of folding slices before biting into them, and the crust at Terroni is so thin and pliable I always envision myself folding a whole pizza in half,...and then in half again...and then having my way with it.

Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's ""Eat Drink Man Woman"", and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.

Three hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...

Momofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC & Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.

With the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.

As you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.

First we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!

Next came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!

We then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and crudité; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.

And then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.

Lastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,

We decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.

All in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic. Good friends and good food - what could be better?",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

Cut off from the cozy front bar space, you can't help but notice how welcoming Globe's dining room is; distinguishingly set tables, character hardwood floors, and an interesting play on shadows and lighting all come together to create a soft and intimate space. It draws you in as soon as you enter, and it gives you the feeling that you're in for something special.

With considerate, friendly, detail orientated staff, the service at Globe doesn't disappoint. While it might have partly been because we were among the first tables they had in for dinner that night, we were warmly greeted by the entire front house as we were led to our table. No matter what business you're in, that type of attention scores big points.

Trouble is, I was there to eat, and most of the food at Globe fell a little flat...
There's a lot to be said about going local. With hype from the 100 Mile Challenege and a seemingly growing concern for eating local and sustainable, people are looking for food that's produced closer to home and with a smaller carbon footprint. While Globe's focus may be on local, it's hard to identify exactly how close 'local' is since they have items sourced from as far as Kelowna and Vancouver.

The West Coast Dungeness Crab starter was overcomplicated, which made it slightly hard to identify what the heck we were eating. Besides the obvious crab meat, which was subtly sweet and perfectly cooked, the plate also had a far-to-large savoury panna cotta and some haphazardly scattered popcorn. Yep. Popcorn. While the consistencies were actually pretty good, it was mostly a confusing dish to eat that came with no explanation.

The Second Winds Farm Elk main was a little too simple; too little color, not enough flavor, and effortless presentation. While the elk loin was perfectly cooked, the braised shoulder was tough and near-tasteless. The best part of the dish was the corn polenta.

Much the same with the pheasant, which also served the meat two ways. While the citrus breast was moist and tasty, the jerked leg was tough and lacking spices.
It's really too bad, because I truly wanted to love Globe. From the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff, I was sure I was in for something special.

Perhaps simpler is better, especially since what we're talking about here is a focus on local ingredients. Great cooking is all about balance, and if Globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes (like the crab starter) and making others slightly more complicated (like the Elk main) and identify where they draw the line on being local, they'd have nothing stopping them.",0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

Yes, it is completely pitch-black, and no, your eyes will not eventually adjust. You can't see a dam thing down there in O.Noir's dark and dingy basement dining room.

Seriously though, O.Noir is easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Toronto, not just because the food and service were awful, but also because I left the place feeling ripped off. O.Noir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it. It was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights off.

First off, the food at O.Noir is horrible. It's just glorified, hotel banquet food. You know the stuff: salad with balsamic vinaigrette, pre-cooked steam-table-held vegetables, chicken with coriander sauce. It was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s; there's nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here. The food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light. You'd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight, they'd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses, like food with strong aromas or flavours. Nope. Just unthoughtful, crappy food. In a way, the food was so bad that I'm glad my other senses weren't heightened by the lack of light.

I ordered the 'surprise' menu. I mean really, why wouldn't I? I'd like to at least try to see if I could use my 'enhanced' senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was I was eating... For me, the 'surprise' was that I still don't know what the hell I ate. No one ever told me. I sort of assumed that once we were finished eating, the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions, but nope, he just took our plates away without any explanation at all.

Speaking of our server, he was one of the worst in the biz. Not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up, but he was inattentive and bored; I don't blame him though, it'd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of O.Noir. He often left us wondering where he was, not because we were in the dark, but because he often left the room or crept up behind us.

The seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too, especially if you're part of a group. In a dark environment, you'd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation. Our seating arrangements at a long, rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alone.

Sitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too. Believe it or not, the servers actually signal that they're entering the room by banging on the door. We must have heard it 40 or 50 times. In a room that is supposed to heighten your senses, this seems absolutely ridiculous. Surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters. If there is, O.Noir didn't figure it out, or they didn't care. They just decided to stick with the loud banging.

Although we couldn't see anything, a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotel-style metal chairs and wooden tables. I mean, I know we can't see anything anyways, but if our senses were supposed to be heightened, then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that. You could argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant doesn't need to spend as much on the space, but I'd argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into consideration.

On the way out, the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel, and right then, it all made sense to me; this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel. It explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture. It confirmed one thing for me: if you're going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark, then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose. There's little doubt that because they didn't, O.Noir sees little repeat business. People come for the novelty, but likely leave disappointed.

O.Noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that. The pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway. I was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark...",15,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-0.4000000059604645

This was the case a few days back when a number of friends thought it would be fun to get together at Axis Gastropub on the corner of Bloor and Markham in Mirvish Village.

Axis sits in the old Rocco's Plum Tomato location and is the sister pub to Axis Gallery and Grill in the Junction. This corner seems to be one of the those 'Bermuda Triangle' hospitality locations, with new establishments failing to get a foothold over and over again. Maybe the Axis folks will succeed where others have not.

Arriving, a number of us remarked that the large room, decorated in a modern style, was a little stark and very empty for the time of day. It certainly didn't scream 'Pub'.

Within seconds we were greeted by the two servers/bartenders and warmly directed to sit wherever we'd like. Both of these guys seemed genuinely happy to see us and quickly told us about the pint special for the day.

Taking a large table in the back of the room, we sat, chatted and waited for our drinks that soon appeared.

Perusing the menu, it was soon clear that this place was trying to please everyone. The choice was almost limitless with the usual pub fare coupled with 'build your own' pizzas and an entrees list that went from curries to fish and all the way back to steak and pasta.

At the server's recommendation we tried the Pulled Pork Nachos. What came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings. Tasty, but not remarkable in any way, and the amount of topping-less dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing. Hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of: 'Okay', 'Not stellar', 'Not that spicy'. Following another suggestion, my Axis Club sandwich soon arrived. A Pub staple, the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs. This club was well prepared, but again not remarkable. Combining chicken breast, ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard, much like what you'd find in a veteran diner or truck stop.

Overall, Axis Gastropub does not live up to its name. It doesn't really feel like a Pub and there isn't anything remarkable about the food. Maybe it is a case of higher expectations, but I can't imagine returning when there are so many other better options nearby.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.0

It's a fun way to people watch, without really having to watch out for them, but it's also a great way to spot new businesses, or old ones for that matter.  The past couple of times I took this trip, I wondered what was in the chalkboard-black building on the corner of Queen and Elm Grove.  I assumed it was a gallery given it was such a big space, and I was half right.  The Mascot is a coffee shop that showcases art...or an art gallery that serves coffee, depending on what you're going for I guess.  I myself was going for the coffee.

At first the place is a bit daunting.  It's quite large, with a lot of negative space, and very limited seating.  There are two barstools at the counter, a few tables that can seat more than one, and a surprisingly comfy blue velvet couch in the front room, but patrons need to be ready to get creative if all of those are taken.  The back room, which houses the artwork offers up a couple Victorian chairs for those who feel like working on their posture, an old elementary school chair/desk combo, and a springy antique rocking horse (???).  I'm not quite sure if that last option is for display only, or for those who like their coffee with a little bouncy nostalgia, but I for one wasn't about to find out.  I used to have one of those horses, and I remember getting pinched by the damn springs on a regular basis.  Luckily for us, there was a free table.

My girlfriend ordered a latte while I went with just a basic drip to see what Reunion Island coffee is like in its most vulnerable state.  I should've went with the latte.  Not that the drip was bad, but the latte was fantastic. It was smooth and strong without being bitter. The Rosetta adorning the foam was a nice touch as well.  (It should be noted that I went back a few days later for my very own).  

As it was around the brunch hour, and breakfast had long worn off we decided to get a couple of treats to go with our coffee.  The edible portion of the menu at The Mascot is provided by OMG Baked Goods, and like the seating, selection is limited.  The cupcakes were tempting but we were in the mood for savoury, so we ordered a ham & cheese quiche along with a stuffed foccacia.

The quiche arrived looking a little bit sad and we faced off as to who would try it first.  We both agreed that it was tastier than we would have guessed, but I've definitely had better quiche.  The stuffed foccacia on the other hand was a nice surprise.  It didn't come to the table looking like much... really just a bun on a plate.  But as with all things stuffed, it's what's inside that counts.  Filled with roasted peppers, artichokes and Asiago cheese, it was not unlike a grown-up Hot Pocket...one that got tired of all the negative attention so it moved out of its parents freezer, and adopted a healthier lifestyle.  The quiche was pushed aside, but later finished - out of hunger alone. 

Food however is an afterthought at The Mascot.  From what I saw, the people of Parkdale go for the coffee, and rightly so.  There was a steady stream of people coming and going, and judging by the interactions, quite a few regulars.  With friendly laid-back staff, good ambience and amazing lattes, I would make it my local too - if only I lived anywhere near it.

Footnote:  Seating doubles in the warmer months, when it's comfortable enough to sit on the driftwood looking bench that runs the length of their storefront.  Another good place to do some people watching.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

One hot and muggy Saturday evening, I found myself walking down College Street in search of sustenance and something cold to slake my thirst. Now, I'm notorious for my inability to make a decision when faced with many options, and College Street has a lot to offer in the way of restaurants. I passed by bistro after restaurant after lounge, growing hungrier by the minute. How did I choose? Divine intervention lent me a helping hand as the sky opened up and let loose a torrential downpour sending me running into the open arms (see: doorway) of Utopia.

It was already jam packed, which had nothing to do with the rain. There was a line-up for tables, but I managed to grab a seat at the bar to peruse both the menu and the environment. What is it about exposed brick and hardwood floors that make a place so cozy? Whatever it is, Utopia has both.

Needless to say, I was immediately enamoured, and when I opened the menu, that bubble remained intact. Now, I wouldn't call myself a vegetarian, nor would I dive into a steak with gusto, so for a selectavarian such as myself, I couldn't have designed a more heavenly menu if I tried. All but three of their appetizers are meat free, and they allow you to substitute soy (grilled or breaded & fried) for meat in most of their main dishes. Meat lovers and vegetarians unite!

And if that wasn't enough, it gets even better! I forgot to mention earlier that in between appreciating the exposed brick and opening the menu, I honed in on the beer selection (tunnel vision at its finest). And it made me smile, for they had KLB Raspberry Wheat on tap. Typically, I like my beer to taste like, well...beer, but I make an exception for KLB, especially in the summertime (although I find excuses to drink it at other points in the year) as the natural raspberry essence paired with the beer itself is possibly the most refreshing combination ever. Like angels dancing on my tongue...delicious, raspberry angels. Its difficult to find on tap, and Utopia has it, so I chalk them up some more points.

I started with the Mumahari Dip (roasted red peppers, pomegranate molasses and walnuts) that comes served with naan. While the dip itself wasn't exactly visually appealing (but really how many dips are?) with a likening to cat food, I was willing to overlook it. The Everlasting Gobstopper of dips, every bite of the Mumahari started sweet, moved onto nutty and finished with a bit of a kick. Delish.

Between the dip and the KLB, I was already very satisfied, but I wasn't done yet. Next came my Grilled Veggie & Goat Cheese Burrito. I love a good burrito, and this one didn't disappoint. Grilled zucchini, red peppers, eggplant, onions and a generous layer of goat cheese came wrapped in a soft tortilla. Served alongside substantial sides of both garden salad and rice, I couldn't finish it if I tried...and I tried. There is absolutely nothing wrong with leftovers though, and I can vouch that a Utopia burrito tastes just as delicious the day after.

On a tight budget? All of Utopia's mains hover around the $13 mark which in my opinion is a great deal considering the quality of the food and the very sizeable portions. I can easily see two people splitting a burrito and leaving the place with full stomachs (and wallets). The only problem with this scenario however, is the lack of leftovers.

If Utopia has any drawbacks, it's that the place is hot in the summer - really, really hot. The lack of air-conditioning combined with the open kitchen may have something to do with it. If I were anywhere else, I just may have been uncomfortable, but I had my pint of KLB, exposed brick, and a smiling bartender that made me feel like I was the only person in the room (okay...now I'm just getting carried away, but that being said the service is genuinely warm). Looking around, even though everyone had a sheen to them, nobody seemed to mind. Everybody just looked happy. People don't sweat at Utopia...they glow.

For a pasta-heavy neighbourhood, Utopia provides a nice deviation. It's the kind of place I could eat at everyday, so it's probably a good thing I don't live nearby, but it will definitely be my College Street go-to. They also have a four season patio (another good reason I don't live in the area, as much to my liver's chagrin, I have an almost instinctual draw to drinking outside).

Utopia is a contradiction unto itself: it's frenetic, but it's calm; blazers sit next to longboarders; meat lovers co-exist amongst vegetarians; it's hot, but oh so cool. As its name implies, this Bohemian spot in Little Italy is truly ideal.",3,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

What makes the experience at Nota Bene so incredible is the total lack of pretense in a restaurant that could easily come across as pompous, and still attract a devoted clientele.

You might find yourself dining with a local politician or celebrity, and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary, all in the same place. The price is accessible, the quality of the food impeccable, and the service instant without being overwhelming.

We started the evening with Chef David's lobster tacos and the margarita fiesta specials. The lobster tacos were served in a lettuce shell, with a chipotle cream, veggies and cilantro ($8). They tasted like something you would find in a great coastal city, and not at all heavy. The lobster special is a great way to settle in to a long evening of wonderful food.  The margaritas were phenomenal, served on the rocks with Avion tequila. We tried a couple of the cocktails and loved ""Chef David's"" traditional margarita with smoked sea salt. The blueberry and pine tips margarita sounds like a bit of an odd marriage, but worked so wonderfully together that we ordered another.

For appetizers we started with the Hamachi ceviche, which is a yellowtail Pacific fish, infused with coriander, lime, avocado, and jalapeño ($16). This dish came highly recommended by our server, and was absolutely worth the hype. The jalapeños offered a very spicy take on the dish, tempered by the avocado and lime.

Next we tried the cavatelli pasta, with a truffle-scented mushroom Bolognese ($16). This dish was surprisingly soft and creamy without any cheese in it, and the truffle mushrooms were divine. We also had the crisp duck salad with sumac green papaya slaw and cashews ($15), and although I am self-admittedly duck averse, I am told it was perfectly crispy and flavourful, and ending up being the favourite appetizer of the evening for my companion.

For our mains we ordered two Nota Bene favourites. I went with the wild Digby sea scallops with avocado purée, Thai curry paste, mango, papaya and peanut salad ($28). For such a tropical sounding dish, the scallops actually had a very Canadian East coast feel to them, the avocado puree adding a creamy compliment to the scallops. Nota Bene specializes in preparing excellent seafood, and I would absolutely come back for this dish again.

We also tried the braised beef short rib with corn truffle, pickled red onions, queso añejo and coriander ($29). The short ribs were tender, succulent and combined with the sharp taste of the queso añejo and the acidity of the pickled red onion, they were layered with flavour and flat out delicious.

With dinner, we ordered a glass of Ontario Pinot Noir and an Argentinean Malbec. The wine list at Nota Bene is extensive, with the full spectrum of bottles, ranging from the $70 to several hundred.

For dessert we sampled sticky toffee pudding ($12) and S'More ice cream ($10). Needless to say, the sampling turned into finishing. Both desserts were exploding with flavour, the pudding a great combination of traditional pecan praline and spotted dick ice cream, taken with a strong espresso; this is dessert to die for. The S'More ice cream was a fun take on the campfire favourite, with a chocolate and graham cracker crumble.

Go try Nota Bene, twice.  Once to become familiar with all that this brilliantly conceived restaurant has to offer and then a second time to cement the relationship in your black book of regular haunts. Service, quality and ambience are all top rate, yet you still feel the passion Nota Bene has for creating a wonderful experience and forming personal relationships with its guests.

I've been looking through what other people have said about Megas, and it's all so bad...really bad. That's where the trouble comes in for me, because I certainly didn't hate it as much as everyone else seems to. In fact, I actually thought I was going to be giving Megas more then 3 stars with this review. Why? This is the second time I've been to Megas. I was only going again because it was so good the first time. But the second time wasn't even a close second.

The big plus Megas has got going for them is their killer patio right on the busier stretch of the Danforth. It's probably one of the best places to sit outdoors on the street. It's a big, covered space that's chock full of people, and at first glance, is difficult not to gravitate towards on a sunny day. 

Once you get over the patio though, and it comes to eating, you're likely to be disappointed; but it's completely dependent on what you order and when you order it. The food at Megas is mostly mediocre, but there are a couple things worth mentioning. While the rice is of the reheated, overcooked, slightly warmed kind, the Saganaki (fried Feta cheese made of sheep's milk) and Taramosalata (Cod caviar spread) is probably some of the best on The Danforth. Seriously, if you have never tried either of these, this is the place to do it. But everything else, order with caution. This place is completely hit or miss, mostly depending on how busy they are.

The inside is sorta your typical Greek place: fake roman statues, stone pillars, and lots of greenery; it's a big space too. If you check it out on the weekend, chances are that big space will have more than one big group, which Megas can provide for comfortably. But that's where most of their issues lie. While they may be able to provide for big groups, it's at the sacrifice of all the other tables. Once Megas gets busy, the service, food quality, and overall experience seemingly drops right through the floor.

Unfortunately, the one thing that is truly consistent at Megas no matter how many times you go there is their lack of caring for food presentation. While most of the stuff they serve seems to be haphazardly dropped on the plate, I don't blame Megas for that. After all, that's pretty much a standard for Greek food; it never seems to be about the presentation. When it comes to Greek food, there's never really a big surprise with what you end up with at your table. You order calamari? It's probably served garnished with parsley and olive oil. You order hummus? It's probably served garnished with olive oil and a lone Kalmata olive. The only difference varying from place to place is whether it's tasty enough to be worth eating.

I'm still slightly confused about whether to recommend this place or not. I mean, they've got a few things going for them. Like I said, the first time was pretty good, and if I knew I was guaranteed that every time, I'd have no problems returning.  Megas basically comes down to this: if the place isn't busy, stop in and check it out; if they are busy, keep walking.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.0

Without giving you an exact number of how many years it's been, I will tell you that Gap wanted everyone in khakis, pagers weren't quite obsolete, and Mambo #5 was tearing up the charts.  So thankfully a lot has changed, but two things remain, and will always remain the same, about student life.  Number one:  students are broke.  Number two:  they are hungry.  Say Cheese is going to make many U of T students very happy. 

I haven't met a grilled cheese sandwich I didn't like, and I haven't met anyone that doesn't like a grilled cheese sandwich.  That might be why so many gourmet grilled cheese places are popping up these days, but it's a risky business.  The people have spoken and they want grilled cheese sammies...but they don't want to pay a lot for them.  After all, you can make a perfectly good one at home with white bread, and cheese that's more plastic than it is dairy.  And that's where Say Cheese comes in.  Nigel Koo, part owner and operator wants to satisfy stomachs without putting a dent in wallets.  He doesn't see why he can't serve up a high quality sandwich at a low(ish) cost and have customers walking out in a lactose induced ecstasy.

It was quiet when I arrived but word wasn't really out yet, and the boys were still experimenting in their test kitchen.  I was happy to be a guinea pig.  I asked to try their most popular meat and veggie options, and this is what followed.  

I started with Indira's Pulled Pork made with Beemster.  Diners can choose to have regular cheese, such as cheddar, on their sandwich ($6.50) or upgrade to a premium choice ($8.50). My creation came topped with homemade mac & cheese (fun!) on whole wheat bread.  I only ate half as I had more coming my way, but the sandwiches here are generous, and I had to pace myself.  The different textures paired nicely, but I would have liked it more had the meat been a touch saucier, or came with something in which to dip it.

Next, came the Italian Classic.  Not that I'm taking bets, but if you put Buffalo mozzarella on anything, I will eat it.  So I was pleased when they said one of their best meatless sellers was filled with the stuff.  I like a good Margharita pizza, and this was the sandwich version.  

As if that wasn't enough (and by all dietary standards, it was more than that) I was offered their dessert sandwich.  It didn't take a lot of prodding, and went something like this;

 Nigel:  You should try our dessert option. 

 Me:  Wow, I don't know.  I'm really stuffed.  Okay.

The French Grilled Toast is like a ménage a trois between a grilled cheese, some French toast, and a piece of cheesecake. It's good.  Scary good.  Filled with ricotta, mascarpone and a berry compote, the sandwich is then dusted with turbinado sugar, and drizzled with maple syrup.  As with French toast, this needed to be eaten with a knife and fork, which probably worked in my best interest as it stopped me from inhaling it.  I will be going back for this one.  As it is now, I think about it more than anyone should think about a sandwich.

So in total I ended up eating just a little bit more than a full sandwich thanks to the few bites I had of the French toast, and I was beyond full.  So much so, that I actually skipped dinner that night. Now by my calculations, that equals two meals for the price of one, and a low price at that. This bodes well for hungry students up to their necks in debt.  

Footnote:  During the week, for a mere thirty minutes between 4:20 and 4:50 you can get yourself a sandwich and side (including soup, salad and possible ramen...) for just $4.20.",11,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

After all, the arrival of littlefish in the Junction has definitely been well received. The neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot. Unfortunately, the arrival of littlefish hasn't completely filled that void just yet. They still have a few kinks to work out, but don't give up on them yet. I won't, but only because I really want to love it.

Ok. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.

The brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.

The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.

The thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.

People rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.

Make no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West, they may not be doing as well as they are now.

So would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.",7,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.0

By top-notch, I mean pizza that is served sizzling and fresh and made with high-quality ingredients. Pizza like that is true craftsmanship; pizza like that I could eat every day. In my continuing effort to find superior pizza, I looked to Lil' Baci in Leslieville. My visit didn't disappoint me.

Lil' Baci's dining room is a decent-sized dining space, but the tables are packed pretty tight, so don't expect too much privacy. You'll likely hear everything that the table next to you is talking about. If you need to escape your neighbour table, in the warmer months you may want to check out the cute backyard patio. Comfortable, busy, and social, it's the place to be when the sun is out.

When I'm eating Italian food, I like to start off with a glass of red vino or cold Italian beer. Lil' Baci's wine list is small but thorough and their beer list offers some nice Italian choices; Moretti and Perroni are my personal favourites.

Lil' Baci has a seriously amazing dandelion greens salad.  If you've never had dandelions as food before, this would be the one to expose yourself to it. The greens are slightly bitter, but the bitterness works well topped with shaved Parmigiano, cracked black pepper, and freshly squeezed lemon. Perfect starter.

And the pizza, they do it right. Lil' Baci has a savoury and seasoned tomato sauce base that expertly compliments the four cheeses that are layered on their Quattro Fromagi; my personal favorite.  They've got some other really outstanding pizzas to choose from like the Margherita (with tomato, basil, and mozza), the Lil' Baci (with pecorino, sausage, and fennel pollen), and the Gorgonzola Dolce (with gorgonzola, Yukon gold potatoes, and caramelized onions). All of their pizzas are served on signature thin crust dough that is seared and blistered perfectly.

Lil Baci has got a really small pasta menu. Ridiculously small. There's only three items. But still, these 3 items are done perfectly. They're all made with quality ingredients and use that great tomato sauce that's on the pizza. My favorite is just the plain ole' Spaghetti and meatballs.  It's got just the right amount of fresh basil, sauce, and Parmigiano. The portion size isn't huge, but with that dandelion salad and something from their Insalata menu, it's more than enough.

Lil' Baci also has a Panino menu, which surprisingly is different from their pizza menu. I love the Panino Tonnato. Packed with Italian tuna, caper aioli, sun-dried tomatoes and arugula, it's perfectly pressed into an amazing bite.

The dessert menu has a few options, but when I was there I had a lemon prosecco tart. The crust was buttery, but a tad on the dry side. The custard-like lemon filling had a refreshing prosecco flavour, which balanced the acidity nicely.

I head to Lil' Baci when I want some decently priced Italian food and some amazing pizza. Lunch or dinner, what you end up with is a steal anywhere in the city!",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.5

That's usually a good sign, and in this case it's definitely true. But waiting for a table isn't all bad; there's lots to see in this place: kitchy cute decor and lots of memoribilia that reminded me of my childhood. When I was there, the place was cramped and full of hungry people, but everyone was in good spirits. 

When I look at the menu, i always find it difficult to make a choice. They've got a big, diverse menu with both savory and sweet items. All of it looks delicious.  

First off, I'm a vegetarian, but, like to get the breakfast pocket, sans pemeal bacon of course.  It's chock full of fluffy eggs, caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun. Aunties and Uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides, but I've never chose anything but the potato salad. Seriously, this stuff is good. A great combo of chunky red potatoes, dill, Dijon and spices, it's savoury and creamy. Admittedly, my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive, so if you go, don't go when you're in a hurry.

Fruit juices and iced teas are good choices, but I wouldn't finish off with an espresso as they may suggest. Their espresso is nothing special and just plain weak, and it certainly doesn't stand up to Manic coffee located just a few doors down. If you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, I'd suggest you head over to Manic.

Aunties and Uncles loses points in service. The service staff seem a bit cold, sorta aloof, and alot grouchy, but despite if you're willing to overlook that, then this is worth a visit if you're in the College & Bathurst area.",0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.

I'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong. 

La Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.

But one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it. 

Perfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.

On this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.

Seriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West. If you're looking for authenticity, you've got a ton of other way-better options in this city.",3,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-0.20000000298023224

Despite the obvious assumptions, Murray does not take kindly to eating regular old hot dogs. He prefers a more delectable, refined meal. What does Murray like the most? Sandwiches, of course! In fact, he loves them so much that he  used all of his love and expertise to build a sandwich shop for his fellow sandwich lovers. Thus, Murray's Sandwich Emporium sprang to life.

I recently found myself in the exact same conundrum as Murray the dog was; I was sick of my same-ol'-same-ol' packed lunches, and I was searching for something better. I know you're thinking that sandwiches have to be the most cliché lunch choice of them all, but one look at Murray's menu, and you'll know that you're in for something much different. 

There is not a huge selection (by sheer number) at Murray's, but each item is unique, and there is a decent range of combinations across the board. There are meatless, chicken, beef, fish, cheese and even sweet sandwiches, plus a decent offering of sides (note: combos and sides are extra). 

The restaurant itself is pretty simplistic. It's small, has exposed and undecorated brick walls and two large wooden tables with stools scattered around them. The chalkboard menu hangs on the wall, and there is a small refrigerator full of beverages just off to the side. It is all very subdued and quite appropriate for a sandwich shop.

I held back a bit on my first trip to Murray's. I didn't really know what to expect, how big the servings would be, and what kind of value I would find there. I decided to go with The Uncle Phil: sliced ribeye, onions, green peppers and ooey, gooey, messy, melty provolone cheese on a beautiful baguette. 

Truthfully, I thought the bread was the best part of this sandwich. I don't feel bad for discounting the meat or toppings because, for sandwiches at least, the bread is just as much a star in the meal as anything else. The baguette was clearly very fresh, they keep it tender (but crispy) and most importantly, not over or under-stuffed. The meat was tender too, but it needed a bit more oomph. The green peppers were just slightly sautéed, giving them a nice crunch and, as mentioned above, the cheese was gloriously gooey. All of that was topped off with a pickle - for nine bucks!

I felt that I didn't really get the whole experience of Murray's my first time around, so on my second visit I decided to get into some side dishes. I certainly didn't hold back on my sandwich choice with The BL-Tizzy - double smoked B, of course some L and T, house-made mayo, avocado and an egg (a $1.00 add-on). I threw all of that into a combo with some onion rings and a can of pop, bringing my total to $12 plus tax. This is a bit pricey in my opinion, but considering the amount of food they give you, it's not so bad. Here again, I thought the bread stood out more than anything else. It was so fresh and tasted of near perfection. Just like The Uncle Phil, the fillings were good but, other than the sheer volume, they were fairly regular...tasty, but regular.

Overall, Murray's Sandwich Emporium offers a delicious product that is definitely over-sized and that will satisfy your hunger. Plus, they're open for lunch, dinner and late-night eats. However, as tasty as the sandwiches are, I can't say anything really blew me away. Yes, the menu item names are unique and fun and the serving sizes are huge, but nothing is really over the top. That being said, sometimes simple is best; they know what they're good at, they know how to make a good sandwich, and they're consistent. 

Good boy, Murray.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

How do I know? I paid $22 for a burger lunch and am absolutely ok with it.

Grindhouse is serious carnivore territory.

The first thing to stand out, though, was my drink. I went for my usual diet cola and I got, ""Sorry we don't have anything with aspartame."" In fact, you shouldn't go there expecting to get your go-to big brand soft drink at all. Well, well, well I better go for something really interesting then. Boylan's Birch Beer - a root beer drink, sweetened with cane sugar, with pure vanilla extract and only one preservative (sodium benzoate, typically used in soft drinks and other acidic preserves). Their amazing dedication to fresh and natural ingredients obviously did not end there.

All of the ingredients are local and fresh, the burger meat comes from naturally raised livestock and is Genetically Modified Organism, hormone and antibiotic-free. You will not find anything that has refined sugars, or artificial sweeteners (hence the lack of Coca-Cola and Pepsi on the premises). They literally prepare everything in-house. The buns are made there and they also make the ketchup and mustard themselves, right in the back kitchen. The ""fresh and never frozen"" attitude is not good enough here; if you're going to do it, do it right.

Their burger creations are unique and creative; a turkey burger with black truffles and cranberries, yes they do have a veggie burger and it's soy-free and, my choice, the black and blue burger are just a few of the menu items. I was presented with a Cajun spiced beef patty smothered in blue cheese sauce and cooked only to medium, with a side of onion rings (who was I kidding with that diet cola anyway).

If you can be sure of the meat quality, requesting a burger cooked less than well-done will give you much more flavour and a better texture. On my first bite there was an immediate rush of barbecue charcoal flavour emanating from the patty; it tasted like summertime. The blue cheese sauce was mild and, considering the Cajun description, it was spiced, not spicy. The onion rings were huge and somehow satisfyingly greasy but unbelievably crispy.

I actually don't often talk about presentation because, frankly, it's all about the taste for me. I have eaten enough beautiful yet disappointing and ugly yet amazing dishes to spend much time considering plating. However, the simple beauty of this burger and onion rings dish was lovely - just a white plate and a burger, without a toothpicked-pickle piercing the bun. Lovely.

Much like my University professors, I hesitate to give out a ""perfect"" score and I can't on good conscious say that this was the very best burger in the city, but - a big but - they gave me something pretty darn close to the best burger around and the attention paid to good, fresh and healthful ingredients truly impressed me.

Their name might be harsh and gory, but you'll find burger-fare inside that is gentle and kind to you and your body.",3,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

Situated at the main entrance of Bayview, now in its third year of business at the mall, and judging by the patrons that came through in our lengthy Saturday afternoon visit, this place is a hit with the locals. Being situated in a bit more of an upscale mall, Aux Delices caters to their clientele. Health conscious foodies will delight in their selection of fresh, gourmet ingredients, including Panini's, pastas, crepes, salads, and even specialties like duck l'orange and homemade gelato, just to name a few. There menu is ever changing, depending on seasonal availability, so there is always something new to try at Aux Delices.

We started our meal with the fresh manicotti and roasted mushroom caps, duck l'orange with mushroom and greens, and roasted eggplant salad. Everything tasted like fresh, home cooking. The manicotti ($6.50) was amazing, with melt-in-your-mouth ricotta, and ripe tomatoes that tasted like they were picked form the garden that morning. The stuffed Portobello mushroom cap with cheese and polenta was an awesome side dish, complementing the Italian flavours in the manicotti, but would be great as an entrée on its own.

The duck l'orange was cooked perfectly, tender and succulent, the sauce was sweet and tangy, and the accompanying side salads of oyster mushrooms and greens, and roasted eggplant were in a league of their own. I would have returned just to try a sampling of all their fresh veggie salads.

Next up, a roasted vegetable Panini, recommended by our host. The yellow pepper, red onion and eggplant were soft and easy to eat, with a nice portion of goat cheese on lovely focaccia bread. Moving into crepe territory, we decided to tackle the ham and cheese crepe ($9.50), with tomatoes as well, and would go back for more. Their crepes are light and fluffy, and packed with ingredients. Even better, your crepe is made right in front of you, and you can add any ingredients you like. A fun experience for kids, too.

For those looking for the ""café"" experience, they serve up delightful illy coffee, and Rahier desserts, that almost make you feel like you are dining in Europe. Their double espressos were great, nice and bold, and the latte was perfect, frothy and steamed to perfection. The homemade gelato was amazing. I love ice cream, and have been a latecomer to the gelato trend, but I am glad that I tried it. We sampled the chocolate, vanilla and pistachio, a must when having gelato, and they were all very well done. The vanilla and chocolate especially, both true to their flavours, with a natural, nuttier taste, rather than overtly sweet.

Aux Delices Café offers a fabulous dining experience, and allows you to stop in for a fast and easy meal, or linger over a cup of coffee and a pastry. All of their meals are available to go, making it a great option to stop in after work for a ready-made meal.

Why are people flocking to these brightly coloured, frosted, palm-sized desserts? Well, I'm sure there is some greater social commentary to be made here about a reversion to childhood or a need for comfort foods in our over-stressed, over-worked lives, but, in the case of Prairie Girl Bakery, it's just simply that they taste so darn good!

Walking into Prairie Girl Bakery is almost like entering a fine clothing store - everything is placed just so. The whole space is pristinely clean and clear of clutter; literally nothing exists except a counter and back-wall display. The cupcakes are kept safely behind the employees, lined up row by row waiting to be selected and boxed up. All of the focus is on their one and only product. There is no time wasted on brewing coffee, serving tea, or making sandwiches. Everything comes down to one thing: the cake and the icing.

When I first walked into the store, I thought I made a mistake. I went in to grab a dozen cupcakes for a work function and was shocked at the lack of merchandise on the shelves. I had to ask, ""was I supposed to pre-order before coming in?"" Not at all. They just take extra care to provide the freshest product possible, promising never to serve a ""day-old cupcake."" So, baking in big batches to keep the shelves stocked to the brim all day is out of the question. The team at Prairie Girl Bakery prides itself on being resourceful and limiting waste; they even take any leftover cupcakes to a local charitable organization, Toronto's Second Harvest, that is dedicated to providing realistic solutions to hunger. Are cupcakes a necessity for a charitable food organization? Of course not, but why not give where you can and provide something a bit more luxurious than canned food to those in need.

The cupcakes come in two sizes, 13 flavours, and an array of beautiful colours. You won't find any unneeded extras here, like (in)edible sugar flower toppings disguising an otherwise delectable treat. The cakes are simple and the swirls of icing are in the spotlight on top of light bases. The range of flavours include peanut butter banana, red velvet with classic cream cheese icing, chocolate-chocolate, chocolate-vanilla, chocolate-hazelnut, chocolate cake with peppermint icing, and my ultimate favourite, chocolate cake with strawberry icing. The strawberry colour was fairly mute, but the flavour was intense. Even more impressive was that the chocolate cake didn't overpower the icing or vice versa. Each deep flavour perfectly complemented the other.

A dozen mini-cupcakes come in at $18.95 and one dozen regular size at $31.95. My gluttonous side will only order the mini cupcakes from now on, allowing me to eat two or three different flavours in one sitting. However, there is something supremely gorgeous about the sight of one of their regular sized cupcakes sitting in it's very own container (complete with viewing window) waiting only for you.

Want to feel a little less guilty about completely indulging in these sinfully tasty treats? Prairie Girl Bakery's dedication to remaining as all-natural as possible streams throughout the whole operation. Not only do they use recyclable cardboard packaging, but they are absolutely free of preservatives, artificial flavours, and hydrogenated or ""trans"" fats. I'd say that's mostly healthy eating.

On one final note, I have to say that I love the mythology around this place. The story is that Prairie Girl Bakery's creator, Jean Blacklock, learned all she knew from her family back on her Saskatchewan farm. She eventually left a career in law to bring that down home prairie, old fashioned baking to us city-dwellers. I don't think there could possibly be more charm or more beauty in the simplicity of what Prairie Girl Bakery is and what they produce.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

The restaurant is decked out art-deco style, with lots of white tile, dark wood and vintage posters lining the walls. Coquine boasts several large dining rooms and a quaint patio, perfect for people watching or a leisurely meal. A large group of us descended on Coquine one Sunday morning for a late brunch, and found the menu to be both classic and eclectic. Let me explain. .

Traditional Sunday morning brunch normally sees a line-up of the usuals; pancakes, omelets and waffles. While Coquine serves up all of these items, they do it all with a pronounced French flavour, not afraid of adding a little gourmet to your breakfast.  Coquine's wonderful Apple Jack's ($11) offers up a stack of fluffy pancakes, topped with delectable caramelized apple and maple syrup. The delightful Vanilla French Toast ($12) is flavoured with fresh vanilla bean and served with a berry compote and Chambord. The Steak Frites ($19) were delicious, and came with a side of Parmesan truffle fries and mayo. While you may not be able to fly to Paris for weekend brunch, you can certainly enjoy the savoury French-style cuisine just south of Yonge and Eglinton.

Everyone found their meals to be excellent, and I can personally attest to both the quality and quantity of the wild mushroom and shallot Quiche with chévre ($14). Coffee (and Bailey's) was always available, and attentive extras like water for the group, and non-stop breadbaskets make the service at Coquine both pleasant and under-stated.

Overall, the value for meals was very good, as portions were large, and fit for sharing. Both the hostess and the server were polite and attentive, but never obvious. With an excellent location between Davisville and Eglinton subway stops, and great food and service, Coquine should be on your list as a must-try for weekend brunch.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.699999988079071

Sitting in a little space out in the Bloor and Lansdowne, Nuthouse has established itself with Blansdowne locals as the best place around to pick up all sorts of interesting products.

First thing you'll notice about Nuthouse is that it smells good...it smells really good...it smells like an incredibly nice mix of high-quality nuts, cereals, grains, teas, dried fruit, lentils, dried fruit, spices, cake, and coffee. It's a smell that right away makes you feel comfortable and assures you that what you're getting is filled with quality. Don't expect to see the typical bulk fare with hundreds of bins full of overly processed and mass-produced stuff; you're in the wrong place for that sorta thing. Nuthouse is full of nothing but always high quality and sometimes organic products.

Ok. That might not be the very first thing you notice. Chances are, if you're walking down Bloor looking for this place, or even if you're not looking for it, the first thing you'll notice won't even be inside the store; it'll be the big, plastic walnut hanging above the front doorway. That big walnut has become somewhat of a landmark item on this stretch of Bloor, even though they've only been in business for a few months.

Nuthouse isn't just about nuts. They carry all sorts of things, from organic candy and fair-trade coffee to raw cereals and handmade soap. And its healthy too. A lot of the stuff they carry is the sugar-free, vegan, raw, organic type of stuff, which makes it a super option for more health conscious people. And if you have dietary restrictions, Nuthouse has got you covered too with tons of gluten and wheat free products, like their spiced carrot cake. If that's your bag and you live in the area, you no longer need to travel far to get these kinda things.

Personally, when I think of organic or locally-sourced or handmade or any other related adjective used to describe stuff in a store like this, I unfortunately also think 'expensive'. At Nuthouse though, that really isn't the case. The prices are actually fairly down-to-earth and mostly afforable. In fact, a lot of the products they sell are actually cheaper than the bulk stuff you find at No Frills, with an obvious element of quality you may not find at bigger places. 

Wanting to try out interesting varieties of stuff you already love, like lentils or rice or yes, even nuts? Nuthouse has got you covered. They carry a ton of different kinds, some of which you probably didn't even know existed. And that brings up one of the best things about buying in bulk in a place like this: you can buy in smaller amounts purely just because you want to try something. Buying in bulk doesn't have to be about being able to get more for less, it's about being able to also get, well, just less. The fact that Nuthouse just happens to make it also affordable is just the icing on the organic carrot cake.",0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

It's a casual place with daily deals (movies, cheap wine on Wednesdays, etc.), TVs showing Blue Jays' games and young staff working feverishly to keep up with the sit-in and take-out clientele.  It's got a pleasant, relaxed vibe and people seemed to be rather enjoying themselves.

Once seated in our booth, we perused the menu and our lovely server explained how the restaurant works: you write down your order on the notepad provided, bring it up to the counter and hand it in. You can either pay right away or begin a tab. Any subsequent orders can be placed through the wait staff. I assume this method is effective for those in a hurry, but it did seem a little odd considering how often our server checked in on us. She also expounded upon the ""red sauce"" pizzas made with Campania tomato sauce, fior-de-latte mozzarella, basil and pecorino romano cheese. (The ""white sauce""pizzas are made with a garlic and olive oil sauce instead of the tomatoes.)

We opted for the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls for an appetizer, the funghi tartufo and San Andreas pizzas and, for dessert, the dolce and banana dish. As with any self-respecting pizza place, they had San Pellegrino on the menu so got an Aranciata (my fave) and a Limonata. My dining companion kindly took the order the counter while I scoped out the huge place before me. Famoso has really nice exposed brick walls, comfortable booths and, by my count, at least three staff members per table. There are a lot of eyes on tables and not much gets missed. The staff is universally nice, if perhaps inexperienced. It lacked a certain finesse, but made up for it in sweet charm.

Our appetizer arrived and I'm glad we asked for salt, pepper and chili flakes. The mozzarella balls were tasty, but the red sauce (which would appear later on our funghi pizza) was very, very sweet. For my liking, too sweet.  A dash of salt and some chili flakes were necessary and helped considerably. I was hoping for crispier prosciutto, too; as a start to the meal, it was pretty average. If you're going to get an appetizer, I would recommend you try a salad. They looked fresh and tasty.

Our funghi  tartufo pizza arrived fairly shortly afterward. It consisted of roasted white mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, truffle oil and parmiggiano reggiano.  Again, it was better with the salt and chili flakes.  The crusts at Famoso are a bit thicker than is the trend right now, but I liked the chewier texture. I only wish that this pizza had been left in the 900-degree oven a little longer as it needed a little more crispiness to counter the soft, melting cheese that was starting to soak through the crust. (A note: I took a slice of this one home and had it two days later. I have to say, it tasted much better as a leftover!)

Our second pizza - the San Andreas - was a ""New World Pizza"" with a white sauce, chili-lime marinated chicken and fresh mozzarella. It was then baked and topped with avocado slices, diced roma tomatoes, onion, cilantro, a drizzle of cream and a lime wedge. Certainly not traditional, but pretty darned tasty. The pizza seemed to have stayed in the oven just that little bit longer and had that nice char on the bottom. The lime juice provided a bright flavour and the chicken was tender. (I'd have liked a little more chicken, but that's a bit of a nitpick. It was a good pizza.) Were I to go back, I would steer my companions toward it if they wanted to try something a little different.

Finally, dessert. This was my favourite dish of the four we tried. A long, rectangular plate of roasted bananas coated in caramelized brown sugar, topped with pecans and caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream in the middle arrived at the table and my eyes widened. This looked and smelled fantasti and tasted even better. The bananas were piping hot and creamy and contrasted beautifully with the crunch of the sugar and the chill of the ice cream. That dish was devoured in what had to be record time.

Overall, Famoso is...fine. There isn`t anything in particular that stands out but there isn't anything egregiously wrong with it, either.  It caters to a wide variety of tastes so it is sure to be a good option if you are going out with a group with varying tastes or dietary restrictions or preferences. Do not bother with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls, but do not skip dessert.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

Their extensive menu holds everything from Calamari Fritti, Insalata Arugula, Papparedelle al Salmone and Penna alla Vodka to Gnocchi with a choice of four sauces, Pollo alla Jolly (chicken in rose sauce) and Margherita pizza (a simple delight of mozzarella, olive oil and oregano).

La Passione balances the traditional with some modern comforts; you can peruse the thorough and interactive website and check out their Facebook page, then go and grab a classic white-clothed, candle-lit table and dip your focaccia in olive oil and balsamic before ordering gluten-free or whole wheat pasta.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting and, as I found out while waiting for my dinner guests who were running late, it is a very comfortable space to sit and relax with a glass of red.

From start to finish, it was delightful. For such a moderately-priced Italian restaurant, they surely hold their own.

I was ecstatic to find that my penne side dish with the Pollo alla Fiorentina - chicken sautéed with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes in smooth and rich cream sauce - could be replaced with tender gnocchi. I truly could eat pasta every day, but gnocchi is my new favourite indulgence. I'm on the hunt for the best in the city and will devour any potato pasta nugget that comes my way in the process.

The veal Marsala entree is adorned with tons of sautéed mushrooms, the vegetables were cut large and almost put the roasted potatoes to shame; it was true Italian comfort food.
And as for the Papparedelle al Salmone, the wide threads of pasta are covered all over with a pink Salmon-infused cream sauce. Rich and smooth, this was definitely the star of our table.

Personally, I can't go to an Italian restaurant that has Tartufo on the menu and not order it - no matter how full dinner has left me. A few flavours are offered, but I finally landed on Tartufo Royale, a tart and sweet pairing of raspberry and chocolate ice creams covered in cocoa and drizzled with chocolate sauce. I also happened to snag a scoop of pistachio gelato, but it didn't hold a candle to the aforementioned chocolate indulgence.

La Passione was a nice surprise, with entrees coming in around $15-$20 and a wide-range of choices on the menu, it is sure to satisfy. They also occasionally post deals on Groupon - it makes for the perfect opportunity to get out and try something new.",5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.4000000059604645

Man, I really wanted to love this place. La Revolucion just looks so dam cool, that I figured the whole experience was going to be amazing. When I was first drawn by the interesting front stained-glass window and poked my head inside to look around, I figured that in no-time-at-all, there'd be a lineup to get in. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be the case anytime soon.

La Revolucion is a Mexican restaurant, but at first glance, it certainly doesn't scream Mexican; after eating there, I'm not even sure that's what they're going for. It's a sparsely decorated joint that for some reason--at least while I was there--feels the need to distance themselves even more from their Mexican roots by blasting annoyingly loud rave music. I mean, their food is the typical, standard Mexican fare you'd expect, like enchiladas and tacos and burritos, but other than that and the few Mexican-esque decorations, there wasn't much Mexican about it at all.

They're heavily pushing the banditos aspect of Mexican culture, which is actually a pretty cool gimic in my eyes. While I get the whole concept of banditos and revolution, it seemed as though La Revolucion fell a little short of their delivery of the theme. While what little decor they have there is mostly bandito-related, the rest of the theme is left to interpretation. La Revolucion does feel as though they're finding their identity, but they have a lot of difficulty conveying what that identity is exactly to their guests. Sitting there, it doesn't feel as though you were part of the revolution, it feels as though you're interrupting them while they plan it, and they can't wait for you to leave so they can get back down to business.

Presentation isn't their strong point either. They haphazardly slap the food down on the plate, without much concern for appearances. My enchiladas were slightly warm and covered in tasteless green salsa; my burrito was humungous, but it was bland and not nearly warm enough. When I asked for hot sauce, because it was nowhere to be found, I got a small ramekin with some sort of sauce, but it's details remained a mystery that was left for me to find out with no explanation from the server, and while you're waiting for that stuff to all arrive, there's no offer of chips and salsa or even water for that matter, which would have definitely improved the experience.

Interestingly enough, before this place was a Mexican place it was, well, a Mexican place. Whoever it is that owns it probably just decided it was time to rebrand, and while that may have been a great idea on their part, the execution of their new brand and concept needs some polishing because it's hard to tell exactly what the concept is. La Revolucion may be a restaurant, but a revolution it is not.",7,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.0

Like most places owned and run by families, this restaurant is small, a bit cluttered with a mishmash of décor and, no matter the number of other patrons there at the time, has a staff that makes you feel like the centre of attention.

They happen to be closed on the weekend, but from Monday to Thursday they are open from 11:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Fridays from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. The hours are slightly odd, but it makes for a great lunch spot, especially for those like me who tend to take lunch anytime between about noon and 3:00 p.m.

They offer a variety of chicken dishes, a number of different sides and even one vegetarian option. You can get a 1/4 or 1/2 rotisserie chicken dinner - white meat or dark meat - with a choice of two small sides for $6.50 - $10.00. For an additional $0.99 (small) or $1.98 (double) you can get a side of onion rings, Greek or Caesar salad.

The menu itself is pretty huge and is filled with quite a few options. The regular roster of sides, for example, includes Portuguese rice, roasted Parisian potatoes, steamed vegetables, French fries, garden salad or potato wedges. Mains include the abovementioned chicken combos, rib combos, a variety of salads and soups, chicken wings and fingers and sandwiches, like pulled chicken, grilled vegetable, grilled chicken, pork or sausage. They even offer catering.

I decided upon the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of Parisian potatoes. The pulled chicken is topped with their ""famous"" hot sauce, served on a white or whole wheat Kaiser and is dressed with mayo, lettuce and tomato. All of this, with a drink, came in at about $9.

One of my all-time favourite side dishes are those lemony, roasted potatoes available at most Greek restaurants. Well, The Rotisserie House's Parisian roasted potatoes are a close second. They are red, probably from Paprika, and just a bit fiery from the restaurant's signature hot sauce. The pulled chicken sandwich was flavourful, tender and also had the same red hue from the sauce.

I do enjoy spicy foods, though I am a bit of a wimp. This restaurant's hot sauce had a great kick and a good flavour, but it won't burn your mouth to the point that you can't taste anything else. This is really important, since they throw the hot sauce on their dishes, whether it's requested or not. Don't fret too much about all the spice if you're grabbing lunch and heading back to the office, you can buy a pack of gum here too!

Considering the size of this restaurant, I was quite surprised by the number of items they have on the menu. It was not overly busy when I walked in, so everything went very smoothly as far as timing and service went. The staff is extremely friendly, but very small, so I am curious to see what happens when it gets really busy. However, they seem to have it all figured out.

If I lived closer to Liberty Village, I could see this being a regular staple for me for a quick lunch, or to grab some dinner on the way home from work. The prices are reasonable, the food tastes good and it's quick and satisfying.",5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.4000000059604645

If you've been to Bloor West Village, you know that there aren't a lot of patios in the neighbourhood, and any patio that you do find is likely going to be small, cramped, and full of people. With the exception of the Firkin on Runnymede, Dark Horse has one of the biggest and best outdoor spaces in the village to drink pints, people watch or eat burgers and fries.

But, as many people have pointed out before me, the service can range anywhere from slow to crappy when you're sitting out there. While you're waiting, you may even be waiting so long for service that you'll feel compelled to go inside and get your own drinks, which causes the server to give you attitude when she eventually gets to your table, which causes you to feel uncomfortable; you see the vicious circle taking shape here...

All-in-all, the food at Dark Horse isn't half bad. Granted, they aren't going to win any awards anytime soon, but for pub food that goes well with a few drinks, it's pretty decent. While some of the food, like the calamari and nachos, is previously frozen and highly unimaginative, other items, like their Village Burger or fish and chips, are clearly made in-house and truly tasty. They also serve a weekend brunch that is worth checking out, but expect to wait for a table; it fills up quickly with the neighbourhood locals.

All of the expected draft options are here...I think. Truth-be-told, the server never actually rattled off the draft list to us in the limited time she spent at our table. Luckily, there were a few beer-branded signs in the patio, which makes the process a little easier, but a lot less convenient.

Dark Horse's problems are easily fixable; they just need a bit more staff. Trust me, sit back on the patio, have a pint, and watch them work. It'll quickly become obvious that they're understaffed. Another server or two during their busier times, and Dark Horse could be fantastic.

Truth be told, it's just a pub, and a fairly average one at that. If you're in a hurry, you may want to avoid this place, but if you've got some time to kill and want to soak up some sun on a patio, Dark Horse provides nicely.",3,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.0

The dimly lit house-turned-restaurant with the splendidly seamy vibe immediately and completely tugged at my heart strings.  I loved the rickety setting and little details like the ""Draught: Use Your Eyes"" sign behind the bar.

But, as with any new love, first impressions can often deceive you; The Central played with my emotions.  The menu - and be warned the online menu is not what you will find when you arrive there - has so much potential and I very much wanted the food to live up to my expectations.  My party of three shared grilled calamari with side of salad greens in a light citrus dressing, followed by entrees of grilled mushroom salad with shrimp, a grilled vegetable sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a cheesesteak sandwich with Tom Yum soup, all of which (with three beers) came in at just over $60.

The menu items are not very risky, but still need to be done carefully to be successful.  As much as I wanted everything to come out perfectly, it simply did not.  First of all, the calamari was a very large serving - so far, so good.  But, in grilling it whole, the tips became overcooked and the centre remained undercooked, and there was a hint of burnt charcoal flavour.  The grilled vegetables were also overcooked, producing an all-over brown hue, making them completely lose their individuality.  The cheesesteak had the right flavour, but again, the beef was slightly overcooked and chewy.  Finally, after looking forward to trying one of the desserts in hopes for menu-redemption, like the candied strawberries or the ever-infamous deep fried Mars bars, we were told that all they had available was ice cream.  Not so impressive.

While the main dishes and lack of desserts were disappointing, I do have to commend them on a couple of things.  All of the side dishes were on-point; the dressing on both the calamari dish, and the mushroom salad were light, flavourful and had a good citrus tang; the sweet potato fries were crispy, and came with a side of a creamy cinnamon dip that was a great alternative to regular ketchup; and the Tom Yum soup was hot, spicy, and a great choice for a chilly December night.

I have decided that The Central could very well become a favourite spot of mine for drinks, and maybe appetizers, but is just not an ideal choice for a full dinner.  The venue itself is one that you should check out, and I expect it is only better when the patio is open in the summer.  If you don't want to sit in the main bar to listen to the band they have a cozy lounge space upstairs that can be rented for private parties.  Also, they clearly take pride in the beverage menu, especially the beer choices.  When we had some trouble deciding on a pint, we were offered a sample of a new label on tap called Netherworld, a Flying Monkey brew, which is similar to the popular Mill St. Tankhouse Ale.

I give them an A+ for atmosphere, but only a gold star-for-effort on the menu.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.10000000149011612

What seemed to be a quiet Saturday evening when we first arrived at 7pm, quickly turned into a fairly busy ""club"" like dining experience. And Everest is certainly dressed to impress. The restaurant feels both sexy and modern, with dark mood lighting, clean lines, comfortable and cozy booth seating, and an eclectic playlist/DJ, depending on what night you are in. With a great view of Queen West for people watching, and MuchMusic across the street, the atmosphere, music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the locals.

I was very excited to try a new place with an interesting food theme, something a little different from the usual weekend dinner and drinks, and hoping to find a new ""go-to"" place for a fun and creative meal. I secured reservations before our arrival, however, we were greeted with a bit of a frosty reception, waved to an area in the front of the room, and told I could sit wherever I wanted. Unorthodox, maybe, but sit we did!
Putting the hostesses' indifference behind us, we decided to delve straight into the wine menu, and with a little help from our server, selected the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Knights Valley, a California vintage from 2009 for about $40. The wine was excellent, and I found the wine menu to be well priced for the quality of wines on the list.

The dinner menu ($15-$20) presents a somewhat more challenging predicament. Filled with Tibetan and Indian dishes, along side the same old North American stand-by of pasta and sandwiches, I found myself unsure if this was a Tibetan restaurant, or your average Italian eatery all dressed up. It's not that I mind an eclectic menu, in fact I appreciate one, however when venturing out to try a new type of cuisine (in this case, Tibetan), one wants to be sure that the restaurant is absolutely committed to their craft, and have their ""specialty cuisine"" down pat. Thus, I was unsure of whether venturing into the momas (Tibetan dumplings) and sha-momo (spinach and beef), or the fettuccine alfredo was the better option.

After some quality deliberation between the Tibet/North America paradox, I decided to try a platter, a mix of several different Tibetan style foods, to allow myself to experience as much of the cuisine as possible. The menu seemed heavy on potatoes, stewed meats and rice, so I decided to try almost all of the above. The stewed potatoes were good, cooked just right, but tasted much like something I could make at home, no real special spice or flavour that made me feel like I was trying something exotic. The rice was cooked with raisins, which just didn't do it for me, and was a little bland.  My meal was served with steamed Tibetan vegetables (broccoli and carrots), which aside from not seeming exceptionally Tibetan to me, were surprisingly good. An interesting side note, both of our meals were served with naan bread, which really was just pita bread from my estimation. Overall, I was fairly underwhelmed by my choice. My friend ordered the butter chicken on rice with naan bread (same problem), and said that she enjoyed her meal. The butter chicken looked and tasted pretty standard to me, so that must be a good thing, but neither of us could really wrap our heads around the lack on naan bread at restaurant serving Indian food. 

While I thoroughly enjoyed Everest restaurant for its attention to the design décor and ambience, I was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into Tibetan food. I think the next time we decide to go out for Tibetan style cuisine, we will try ""Little Tibet"" further down Queen Street.",0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

It's a little cafe chock-full of character and a cool, homey-sorta vibe. You know the type of place I'm talking about: mismatched plates and cutlery on the tables, Value Village-esque paintings and pictures on the walls, slightly damaged panelling on the ceiling. It sorta looks like one day someone decided: 'Well, we have a stove. Why don't we open a restaurant?' It seems random, but truthfully, it doesn't matter all that much. If anything, those details make it better and much more comfortable.

There really isn't that much for food here. They've got a couple of items that are fairly easy for the lone person working to make when the place gets busy, which it definitely does. Mostly it's just the standard pressed sandwich kind of thing. No soup, no fries, no salad, as a side anyways. The friendly guy working there told me that it's not that kinda place. He said that it's mostly a cafe and a place to drink booze.

The menu is up on a chalkboard, and like I mentioned, it mostly has pressed sandwiches, like grilled cheese with apples and Tandoori chicken stuffed Naan bread. The sandwiches certainly aren't bad, but sadly, the majority of the stuff they make seems to have been brought in with little of it made in-house, like the Naan bread. The Naan was the kinda stuff pressed and packaged somewhere distant, and then bought at some grocery retail giant. It definitely would have been better if they worked with someone local to get some truly authentic stuff. They do have quite a few baked goods too. I'm not sure if those were made in-house or not, but they look nice next to a cup of the great coffee they serve.

I've seen some pictures of brunch items at Holy Oak, like eggs Benny, but based on when I was there I couldn't see that happening. Maybe they do bring someone in on the weekends to cook, but they guy working never mentioned it to me when I asked him about the food or the limited menu.

I went during the week for lunch, and this little place was pretty packed. Mostly with twenty and thirty somethings in front of laptops. It seems like a pretty cool place to work for those of us that frequent coffee shops for that sorta thing, because there really isn't much else in the neighborhood that offers it. It's cozy and comfortable, and I could easily see myself sitting there with a coffee, comfortably typing away.

Holy Cafe is a neat place, but it certainly doesn't warrant a big trip to get to it. If you happen to be in the neighborhood and you're looking for a comfortable place to soak up WiFi and get a decent cup of coffee, Holy Oak can definitely provide.

I mean, I know the restaurant options in Bloor West Village are limited, but I really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did. With horrible service, brutal food, and staff that spent more time admiring themselves in the mirror than their customers, they created a place that was meant to be avoided. Yet somehow, it managed to exist on that corner for years.

So, imagine my surprise when I saw the beautiful sight of a building permit and brown construction paper covering their windows one day...

A few months later, The Kennedy Public House was born. And boy-oh-boy, this place is exactly what  BWV needs. BWV is virtually void of restaurants serving great food. Ok, so there's earth and Dr. Generosity, but other than that, your choices are pretty limited compared to the tons of options available to other Toronto neighbourhoods. That's why seeing something as untraditional in BWV as The Kennedy is such a welcoming sight.

The Kennedy has a cool vibe that, if you know the neighbourhood, you wouldn't expect to see there. It seems oddly out-of-place while at the same time seems oddly comfortable being there. With a laboriously nice interior space, the entire design is well-thought out a nice to be in. But surprisingly, The Kennedy isn't just nice to look at; it also has exceptionally good food.

The Kennedy's menu doesn't serve your typical pub grub; it's much more imaginative than that. Non-traditional items, like polenta burgers, calamari po'boy sandwiches, and pork belly casoulet easily compliment more traditional pub fare, like wings, macaroni and cheese, and thin crust pizzas. Their menu does a fantastic job of covering everyone while still remaining concise and well-thought out.
Working with a number of local businesses, the Kennedy also proudly sources bread and meats from places you're probably familiar with, like Cobs bread and Wellington County Beef. Nice. I've always found that knowing where the food comes from somehow makes it taste better.

One other thing worth mentioning: The Kennedy has unisex bathrooms. And they've incorporated them into the place really nicely, except for the hand-dryer. The bathroom hand-dryer must be the loudest dam one in the entire free-world. If you happen to be sitting in the back-half of the restaurant, it might even ruin your experience. Hopefully they'll turn to either cloth or paper towels, or they'll just find one that is quieter.

Keep in mind though, if you're looking for a relaxing experience, this isn't the place. With strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a Montesorri school, and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at John and Adelaide, The Kennedy doesn't provide a quite and relaxing experience; what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldn't expect to find in a typical public house.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

An easy walk from the Rosedale subway stop, we went the evening of the Stanley Cup final, expecting the place to be packed, but managed to find comfortable high-top seating, and friendly service, amidst a fairly busy night.

The Rebel House is a small pub, with a quaint upstairs section, where we sat. Several TV's aired the hockey game, and there was an eclectic mix of people, some older, into their 50's, but predominantly a mix of twenty and thirtysomething young professionals and students.

The menu is varied, but small, although they offer a revolving door of several daily specials that seem to be based on season and availability, which is always a good bet.

My dining partner decided to go with the daily special Mussels ($14), absolutely delicious in a white wine and garlic sauce, with toasted garlic bread. I ordered the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies ($10), small appetizer-sized cheese patties, with nary a spinach leaf in sight...nor were they spicey. No matter. These delightful little morsels were crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and came with a delectable tomato chutney and sour cream to top with. At our server's suggestions, I also ordered the Spinach and Apple Salad ($6), with cheddar cheese, toasted almonds, and a homemade maple dressing on the side. A wonderful combination. In fact, we liked the cheese pennies so much, we ordered another batch, only to find that that a repeat order isn't always as good the second time around. These pennies were so thick with grease, I found myself soaking up the oil slick with a napkin just to get them down. I think ordering a third time might have settled this dilemma for good, but for now I choose to remember the experience based on my initial encounter with the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies; delightful.

My dining partner, an ""adventurous"" drinker himself, ordered a Labatt Blue, but it did come in the extra large bottle, which made him smile from ear to ear. I ordered the Henry of Pelham Pinot Noir to start, but must admit that it tasted watered down and a bit weak. Not to be discouraged, I tried the 2006 Cabernet Franc Special Reserve VQA after dinner, and was pleasantly surprised by one of the nicer glasses of wine I have had at a pub in some time. It had a heavy quality, with a nice vanilla finish. I would go back to Rebel House just to try this glass of wine again.

Our server was friendly and talkative, and the prices at Rebel House are fairly reasonable. Wine was about $7-$8 a glass, and our meals were between $8-$12 for the appetizers, and up to $20 for an entrée. Except for the bad experience with the second order of cheese pennies, Rebel House is an excellent neighbourhood pub, serving up good food at good prices.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.5

In a desperate attempt to finally darken the doorway of Hey Lucy, I was disheartened to find that going right after work is not nearly early enough to snag a table for cheap martini Wednesday at that popular King West spot. Enter stage-right, Ultimate Café (a bit of Entertainment District fun for you there). Whether coincidentally or strategically, they also offer their own cheap martini Wednesday - how clever. 

Their menu is fairly standard, including soups, nachos, sandwiches and Paninis, pastas and salads and they say the ingredients are bought fresh daily from Kensington Market.

After my first meal, I decided to do some reading and collect the thoughts from others before making my final decision on Ultimate. The reviews are mixed, and I have to agree with that sentiment.

I've now been to Ultimate twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. The night of the martinis, I decided to make a meal of appetizers - a favourite thing to do. I had the spring rolls and the sweet potato and lemongrass soup. I wasn't disappointed in the least; the spring rolls were crunchy and hot and the soup, though a tad too sweet for my own taste (always a risk for sweet potato dishes), was flavourful, thick and rich. It was a satisfying meal but, much like the menu, was basic stuff.

Then, I went back for lunch. 

We started with the nachos which turned out to be a delight. They look completely unimpressive, but once you dive in you'll realize that there is just the right amount of melted cheese, neither scorched or soggy, and it's topped lightly with chopped lettuce, tomato, olives and jalapeno. I have come across some online grumbles about the portion sizes, but any more and it would have proven far too big for a two-person starter or a one-person meal. My entrée was the Montreal smoked meat Panini with a side salad. The Panini was my favourite dish there by far. The meat was warm and tender and, again, was not over-sized. The sandwich was obviously freshly pressed and there was a tangy mustard spread topping it off. But, here's the rub - the salad was small and the leaves were wilted, which is a common complaint across the boards about their greens and the dressing could not possibly have been made in-house. It maybe could have passed for garnish. A really top-notch side could have elevated this dish to be lunch-time excellence. Like the portions, the prices are decent, with both of my visits coming in at just around $20 per person

There is one very short footnote-type comment that I must leave you with. On both occasions I was greeted by an employee whom I can only assume is the host. He will nab you on the street when you stop to glance at the menu to convince you to come in and, though he means well, will be extremely present during your time there. I can't say it was bothersome enough to warrant a phone call, but I also cannot give you my recommendation without mentioning this very obvious addition to the dining experience at Ultimate. 

So, I toyed with a 2-star vs. my decided upon 3-star rating. The decor is kind of cool, the service was fast and courteous, despite the over-attentive host and we were seated in no time on a busy night. They offer some pretty good, if not somewhat lack-lustre grub, with at least one amazing sandwich. 

Just doors down from the previously reviewed Joe Mamas, King West is turning out to be a favourite food stop for me.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

Kent is just one of a series of 'Duke Pubs' scattered around Toronto, and judging from the fairly comprehensive website, each has a slightly different décor, but all of them seem to tap into that English corner pub ambience.

After a long week at work, I was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint, enjoy some hearty food, and catch up with some friends; the Duke of Kent was a great choice...for the most part.

I snagged a corner booth with my dinner group on a busy Friday night.  When we first walked in, it seemed hopeless. We wanted dinner, but there was nary a table to be seen.  The staff did everything they could to make a space for us so we weren't forced back out into the cold to one of the other countless restaurants in the area.  That is what service is all about, and we were happy to stay.  Many thanks to the serving staff for being so accommodating on a hopping Friday night!

As for the food, it is the expected and welcomed pub spread.  They offer up fish & chips (yes, served in a basket on paper), pot roast and potatoes with buttered peas, and even bangers and mash.  You will find an array of reasonably priced English pub food on the menu, with entrees coming in at about $12 across the board.

As I've said before, I tend to go for the specials, and that night it was Moroccan Stew.  Unfortunately, I am sad to say it was disappointing.  The dish was somewhere between a curry and a Mexican chili, and I was given a healthy serving for the $12.99 price-point.  But, I couldn't help but become envious of those around me who had gravy-topped pot pies, crispy fish and chips, beefy burgers and gooey quesadillas.  I probably would not have been as put-off by the it if it was labelled on the menu, as it was on my bill - just 'vegetable stew'.  It was not as exotic as the name lead me to believe, and with a delicious-looking curry dish on the main menu, I expected more spice and life in my 'Moroccan' Stew special.

For a visit to the Duke, I suggest going full-English.  I saw enough plates of fish and chips go by to convince me that it is a popular item, and how much more traditional can you get than that?  Also, I have the 'famous' deep-fried pepperoni targeted - it has to be famous for a reason!

At the end of it all, the Duke of Kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd, and provides a great atmosphere and service, albeit a bit slow - but hey, it was busy!  My food may have only been so-so, but the brew was cold, and my night was great.",3,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only décor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.

Savoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.

Now, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it. It's soft, cooked perfectly, and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor. I've stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else. If you're there, definitely order it.

Pleasantly enough, this place is never at a loss for staff. Any evening you decide to go, you're sure to be taken care of. One of the things--and I cant believe I'm saying this--is that this place may actually be overstaffed. I've gone there before and felt as if I may have been the server's only table, despite being a packed house. It's a true joy to experience.

I know I said that the ugly bar and awkward entrance-way don't matter, and they don't for me. But if you're after more than just amazing Indian food, like say, an authentic setting and traditionally dressed staff, then you may want to keep looking; you won't find that here. What you will find is skillfully cooked, delicious food served to you by exceptionally attentive, friendly staff.",8,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

It might be a little too unassuming for its own good, as many people seemed to question its whereabouts when I mentioned its name...but maybe Bar Salumi doesn't like the spotlight.  Indeed, its sign is almost an afterthought, with the store's original signage for an antique shop, dominating the storefront.

My friend and I had been meaning to go ever since she discovered they served Burrata pizza.  She really has a thing for that cheese, and I can't say I blame her. It's delicious.  We went awhile back, excited at the prospect of this new twist on a Margharita pie, only to find out the chef was on vacation and they were only serving up the liquid portion of their menu.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, and in some cases I would actually prefer it, but that night we were hungry and consequently, deflated. My friend entered the chefs ETA in her phone, and we vowed to return.

Two weeks later, the alarm sounded, reminding us that the chef was back to work (and also that she had golden potatoes ready to harvest in Smurf Village).  We went the very next day.

As it was on our previous visit, Bar Salumi was quiet and dark, illuminated by flickering chandeliers (leftovers from the former antique shop maybe?) and tea light candles housed within mason jars.  Hanging legs of prosciutto fight for space with ceiling fans, and a boar's head watches diners from high above on the back wall.  I know it might not sound like it (what with the strong presence of dangling cured meat and taxidermy) but it has a real romantic vibe happening.

There is no kitchen at Bar Salumi, so our personable apron-clad server was also our chef.  The menu is a small one, focused on pizza and apps, so diners can watch as everything is prepared behind the bar. It did get a bit hot, what with the pizza oven operating from within the same room, but think how cozy that would be on a winter's night.

The menu is presented on the wall in cafeteria style (or bowling alley) fashion, with those little plastic letters that slide in and out, and I half expected to see nachos and cheese listed somewhere.  More menus were brought to us on mini clipboards, and because the food menu was unnecessary as we had fully rehearsed our order, we paused awhile over the drink list.  They offer a thoughtful selection of reds and whites as well as some interesting cocktails.  We went with two glasses of Malbec ($12 each) to go with our starter of olives & nodini with ricotta salata ($4).  So far so good, except that I couldn't help but think the nodini crackers weren't the most functional choice for the cheese...more like basketball hoops for the olives.

Our pizza ($14), although not wood-fired, did come served on a cross-section of a tree trunk.  With the creamy white Burrata blending with the red of the San Marzano tomatoes, punctuated by basil it was like an homage to the Italian flag.  I wish I could say that the Burrata we were so looking forward to, made it the penultimate Margharita experience, but it was like any other made with Bufala.  The two are from the same family after all, so I'm not sure what we were thinking.  Cheese does things to people.  That being said however, we weren't disappointed, as the sauce was tangy, the crust was crispy, and it was big enough for both of us to eat and still take home leftovers.

I wouldn't rank the pizza with the likes of pie giants, Terroni or Libretto, but Bar Salumi is rife with ambience where the aforementioned aren't.  The promise of Buratta may have lured me in the first time, but it's the character that will bring me back.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.10000000149011612

Walking into Hey Meatball! instantly feels like you are walking into your old high school cafeteria. A few two and four person tables are set up, and there's one long 16 person table down the middle, all this in a space that was clearly not built for this many diners. I wasn't entirely sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait for direction. We inquired with the cashier/order taker/owner to find out. I know he was the owner because he told us.

For a restaurant that serves all meatballs, all the time, we were surprised to find that there were only three entrée selections on the chalk board and a few side dishes to choose from. Of the four side dishes, two had already been crossed out for the day, leaving a side salad or butternut squash soup. I decided to order the vegetarian eggplant 'meatballs' with polenta and parmesan, and my dining partner ordered the Porky  meatballs, (a combination of pork and ground beef) with tomato sauce on spaghetti. Immediately I was told that they were out of polenta and was asked ""what would I like it on?"" Unsure of my options, even after asking, I replied with ""spaghetti,"" as that was the only thing on the chalkboard that I was sure that they had in stock.

We each ordered a homemade cream soda, we were given a number, and we took a seat. Our number was called out about 10 minutes later, and we immediately noticed the disparity in portion size. My eggplant 'meatballs' were served on a huge swirl of very al dente spaghetti, whereas the porky meatballs arrived on what could be considered an order from the children's menu- if there was one that is.

The food was good, but not great. The eggplant 'meatballs' had a nice consistency, and were spicy and full of flavor. The tomato sauce that the dish was served with was hearty and not too salty, however I thought that the pasta could have been cooked a little more. The Porky meatballs were excellent, the combination of pork and beef proved to be a hit, however we both found that the tomato sauce served with the meatballs was far too sweet for the savory nature of the dish.

The saving grace of the meal was the amazing cream sodas they make fresh on site. They were a throwback to the Jones cream soda that you used to drink as a kid, but without too much fizz. Unfortunately, when the beverage you order to go with your meal is the best part of the experience, you know that there is something missing.

Hey Meatball! is missing the warm and friendly atmosphere you would expect to find in a restaurant with a wide open kitchen, communal tables and a chef that endeavors to use ingredients within a 100-mile radius of Toronto. All great qualities to have in a unique restaurant with a unique concept, but here, it just didn't seem to create anything memorable. There was no music playing while we were in, and the gruff reception and fluorescent lighting that made it a little harsh on the eyes made Hey Meatball! mostly a letdown.",5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.0

Craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its Junction location (sigh, I remember the days when they avoided this area). And although I spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, I only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago. That's mostly because it's a difficult place to notice, with an unassuming, simple '3030 stenciled on the front door, and not much else to identify it.

3030 is huge inside... seriously huge; especially for a place in The Junction. Stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars, it seems more like you're in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant, and that's with good intention. 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a food-venue, and in my opinion, not the other way around (although that's what they go for in the off hours).

One thing's for sure, they put a lot of thought into their draft selection. The back bar has taps full of local-ish craft brews, including Wellington, Beaus, and even some other, more difficult one's to find, like the Junction Craft Brewing's IPA (which was fantastic), a Sawdust City stout, and a Broadhead White. Clearly, they take their beer selection very seriously. The unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on, you get the distinct that they don't want you hanging out there.

Much like you'd expect from a place aimed at young-pros in The Junction (sigh), the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out, with shelves full of board games and walls lined with old-school pinball machines and plenty of interesting art. With the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening, it gives the perfect backdrop to a night out.

But with just a little '5 dollar snack menu' card on each table, you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks. Our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve (there was only 4 of them at the time) but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right. I asked if the items changed daily, hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them, but nope, these items had been here for a while she said. While it's cool to try items out to see what works, I hope that eventually they'll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu, or at least one that changes seasonally.

Because none of their mains sounded appealing to us, we instead opted for the items on the snack menu. The Butter Chicken Wings, while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours you'd expect, arrived lukewarm. The Potato Wedges on the other hand, were indescribably and inedibly  hot, which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways. Overall, we just didn't find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at all.

If you're in the neighbourhood, 3030 may be worth checking out, but I'd say solely for their draft selection; and although the fact that there isn't much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out, I'd wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek. In my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for.

With a Gabby's now opened next door, I remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence. It's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.0

Keep in mind though, this takeout shop isn't Rodney's or Oyster Boy, and I'm definitely not trying to convince you that it is. In fact, Buster's Sea Cove isn't even in the same boat. At Buster's, you won't find soft lighting, romantic ambience, or table-side service, but what you're pretty much guaranteed to find, is some killer seafood served up really, really quickly.

Fresh-made fish and chips are the staple in this place, but they've got so much more than that. Their huge menu has everything from crab cakes and clam strips to fried oysters and fish-topped salads. And their fish-type sandwiches, something that they happen to do really, really well, are outstanding. I'm not talking about your standard old fried-fish-on-a-bun here; Buster's rivals the best seafood takeout places with crab cake paninis and seared tuna melts sandwiches.

But don't overlook the fish and chips either. This little takeout stand easily delivers one of the best plates of the stuff in the city. They've got a few varieties of fish to choose from, and each of them is served up expertly battered and crispy. Each plate of fish and chips also comes with in-house made fries and a killer slaw.

Buster's also has a few other options you wouldn't expect from a takeout stand. Grilled swordfish, seafood bisque, rainbow trout, even octopus to name a few. It ain't fine dining by any means, but they truly do push the limits of what takeout is both in quality and selection.

Chances are though, once you get your food you'll be spending most of your time searching for a place to eat it. Busters only has 4 tables or so scattered around in front of the counter, but if those are full-and they probably will be-you're on your own. There's an exit close by to the Market's back patio and parking lot where most of Buster's customers end up, but trust me, if it's a nice day out, that'll fill up pretty quick too and you'll be left looking for a place to eat your by-then-getting-cold food.

Truth be told though, even if you're standing out back of the market among parked cars and alleyways, it won't matter all that much. You might not even notice. Whether it's a crab cake sandwich or plate of fish and chips, the food at Buster's is just that dam good.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

You can walk in to place your order or call ahead for pick up or delivery; they add a reasonable $3.00 delivery charge for the area nearby and $5.00 + for further surrounding areas, depending on the distance. If you call with special requests or large party orders, the chefs will accommodate you in a very timely manner - if it's not on the menu, just ask!

Just like the fish, the interior is raw. There is actually one very small table with some chairs around it by the front window, but I've never seen anyone sitting there. There's a display that sits just to the left when you walk in, covered with bags of Japanese snacks for purchase and, on your right, you'll find shelves filled with a few groceries; dried sheets of nori is one recognizable item that jumps out immediately.

Chef John Lee has been serving up fresh and beautiful sushi platters at this location since 2005. It is impressive to note that he worked under the iron chef himself, Morimoto. There is something soothing about the fact that they prepare your food behind the counter in full view. It's that commitment to preparing and presenting the freshest ingredients that has built their dedicated customer base.

Lunch combos range from $15 to $25 and dinner combos from $15 to $35. If you choose the sashimi - individual pieces of raw fish with no rice - it does bring the price up a bit, but it's well worth it for something so delectable. If ordering a la carte is more your style, there are unique rolls to choose from, including: nigiri sushi (fish on rice), small rolls, inside out rolls and special rolls with everything from eel to sea urchin to marinated dried pumpkin.

Our dinner for two was easily fulfilled with the vegetable sushi combo, which includes miso soup, and adding one Una Tekkyu roll (eel, tuna, cucumber, fish roe) and, my sushi must, an order of edamame. The vegetable rolls are prepped delicately to appear as if they too are made with tender slices of fish, the cucumber rolls are a refreshing addition and there is even a roll with an orange, crunchy vegetable called Burdock - carrot-like in appearance and texture, but with a different and unique flavour.

Their fresh ingredients are really the highlight. Nori can easily become chewy and tough, but Marche's is tender and graces the palate without even a hint of the unappealing sea-scent that you might get from a lesser sushi establishment. I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of the cold edamame they serve, but I wouldn't want to trek my raw fish home with something steaming hot resting on top of it anyway, so I don't mind this one pre-prepared item.

If your only sushi experience is picking up a pack of that generic grocery store stuff, with the fake green grass insert, Sushi Marche is really the place to discover all the glory of raw fish.",4,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.4000000059604645

Weekends however, draw a big crowd and my nine-to-five job prevented me from going during the week and avoiding said crowd.  Fortunately, having resigned from my job to be a writer (see: unemployed) I am now afforded the luxury of going to brunch on say, a Tuesday...which is exactly what I did this week.

I love Mitzi's location.  Tucked away on a quiet corner of Sorauren, surrounded by century homes, purple and yellow painted Mitzi's is a bit out-of-place, but that's the appeal.  I have a thing for old neighbourhood general stores, and that's what Mitzi's reminds me of.  Inside looked exactly how I both expected and hoped for; arborite tables with mismatched chairs, a glass display case that housed trays of muffins at the time, and walls adorned with local art.  I really, really wanted to like this place.

And like it I did, however my friend was less than satisfied with her experience.  Let's start with mine shall we?  Mitzi's has a small but thoughtful menu, and I had previously perused it online, so I knew exactly what I wanted.  Craving sweet over savoury, I ordered the French toast as planned ($10.95).  Made with Challah bread it is then topped with a peach & ginger compote, covered in graham cracker crumbs and generously doused with real maple syrup (the last step done by yours truly).  It was fantastic.  The bread was thick and fluffy, and the compote had just the right amount of ginger in it.  It had all the makings of a dessert...in a breakfast.  It should be noted that this dish is typically served with whipped cream, but I decided it was too much of an indulgence (says the person who used so much syrup as to make her French toast wish it had signed up for swimming lessons).

Sitting just adjacent to the expanding pool of syrup, but not completely out of its reach, were the home fries, which offset the sweetness of the French toast nicely.  Made with halved baby potatoes they were spiced perfectly.  My only complaint is that there weren't more of them, but it's probably for the best in the long run.  If the toast itself was the star of the show, then the home fries were the understudy.

As I had already had my morning coffee I chased all of this with a glass of their homemade orange/banana/mango juice.  It was just thick enough to know it was the real thing, and at $3 I think it was good value.

The glowing endorsement ends with my friends order.  She was so looking forward to her poached eggs (also $10.95).  Served on Portuguese cornbread, topped with wilted spinach,  and slathered in roasted red pepper & asiago sauce, it looked delicious when set down in front of her, but as she cut into the egg with her fork, the yolk failed to flow.  Her poached eggs weren't poached at all... they were hard-boiled.  Cue the violins. Tasty yes, but it wasn't what she wanted, and the accompanying rye bread would fail to serve its dipping duty.

This would have been a 4 star review had I made it a solo trip, but alas the poached eggs (or lack thereof) knocked it down a peg.

New to the neighbourhood, but not new to the restaurant scene, Paese has been operating out of their Bathurst street location since 1989.  Serving up Italian comfort food in a casual but sleek atmosphere, Paese might give longtime district resident Kit Kat some competition.

With a monochromatic colour scheme, butcher block tables and exposed brick, Paese is very welcoming, even for someone who happened to be dining alone (see: yours truly).

My server brought the customary bread to the table...but this was no ordinary bread and oil. The bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour.  It came with an olive, rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty.  I tried to stop after one slice, but failed miserably.  I managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't staring at it longingly throughout dinner.

Next, came my Beet Caprese Salad ($13).  Grilled beets came topped with a generous portion of mozzarella di bufala, drizzled with pistachio pesto and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.  The combination of flavours and textures worked well together, and it was just a very fresh salad overall. If seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring.  It was filling enough to be my main course, but I wasn't done yet.

As full of bread and beets as I was, I couldn't wait for my cavatelli ($13).  Hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasn't as filling.  The sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers, and that's a compliment as although she wasn't Italian, she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the years.

I had initially sent away the wine menu, although I'm not sure why exactly.  Maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and I had another review to do...but those are hardly excuses not to partake.  It's part of the job after all.  Either way, one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table.  Smart man.

Paese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle, they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass.  Now I'm no expert on wine, but I do drink a lot of the stuff so I know what I like, and I like Amarone.  I was given a sample of a 2004 Fumanelli Amarone before committing to a full glass, after which I gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up.  Rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as I'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...

Because of its location, I probably won't make a repeat visit but I don't think Paese is having a hard time attracting other customers.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.10000000149011612

It was fairly obvious that the space was still in the process of being turned into something else, and there was still a lot of remenants of Z-Bar to be found. I've been to Z-Bar once, and I couldn't really tell the difference between the two, except for the kick-ass, inviting new Bar With No Name sign out front.

Simply put, No Name's staff are amazing, thoughtful, and exactly how food biz staff shoudl be. They were really concerned with making sure we had a good time, and because of them, our experience was good. Even though the place was busy, they still made time to chat with us and didnt make us feel rushed.

No Name's food menu was the standard bar fare. Burgers, wings, and fried foods were front and center, but despite the plainness of the menu, the food was hot, fresh, and served the way it should be.

The music in this place, however, really needs some improvements. We probably would have stayed for another drink if it wasn't for commercials blasted over the radio being the only form of entertainment. I asked if they could put some sattelite radio on, and I was told not to worry because a DJ was going to be playing soon. I left at 1030, and I never saw or heard a DJ, just Leon's, Loblaw's, and car commercials at full volume.

It does seem as though they rushed to open, and they probably could have used another week or two to get things together, but once they get it all worked out, this place stands a great chance at becoming the perfect neighbourhood hangout.

Pachuco opened its doors on Friday, January 13th, perhaps a sign of bad luck, but that shouldn't hinder their success.

Pachuco is a small (read: reservations) and cozy space, with exposed brick walls, wrought-iron décor and, and a pretty impressive wall of wine bottles lit by a neon sign. Even though Pachuco shares a kitchen with older brother and Danforth favourite  Embrujo Flamenco, they definitely serve up their own distinctive flavour.
Their menu is well thought out and varied, with an excellent selection of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. Their appetizer menu alone is worth the trip. With a confident boasting of guacamole flavours, including goat cheese, blue cheese, smoked trout and walnut, and a guacamole sampler patter that allows you to try three of their creations, there is seemingly no end to the interesting flavour combinations. We decided to stick to our guns, however, and go with the traditional guacamole, which was a stellar choice; lots of lime, onion and creamy avocado, but with no flavour left too overpowering. Their homemade tortilla chips have to be mentioned as well: crisp and tasty. I am hoping they will one day provide these in a to-go bag for purchase before you leave. We also ordered the Chile poblana, swathed in an excellent and perfectly spicy tomato sauce, with queso fresco and refried beans, all baked perfectly. The portion size on both entrees was more than enough for two people, and it could easily serve as a great entrée.

For our meals (both $15) we went with the Taquitos de Machaca (coffee and ancho braised beef brisket, with guacamole and honey chipotle salsa), and the pre-Hispanic delicacy of Taquitos de Huitlacoche (corn truffle, onions, jalapeño peppers, Cazuela beans served with requesón-avocado salsa). Where to start? Let's save the most interesting for last. The braised beef was well cooked and well spiced, the chipotle salsa was a great added touch, and one order of beans and rice between the two of us was more than enough to share. In fact, we both left incredibly full. Their fresh-this-second corn tortillas are amazing, sweet, soft and still warm from the press, prepared just the way you would expect to find them in a traditional Mexican eatery. The Huitlacoche, however, was an adventure in and of itself. 

For those who don't know (myself included), Huitlacoche is a fungus, which grows naturally on corn in damp environments. The fungus is harvested and has been consumed as a delicacy for centuries in Central and South America cuisine. When it arrived, it tasted smokey and earthy; it looked like a dark mash of black corn, onion- and was that a jalapeño in there? Hard to tell. The dish was good, but I can't say I would strongly recommend it. Overall, I found the food at Pachuco's to be mostly over-salted, and the Huitlacoche had to be the worst offender. This is the main reason why I would not order it again; although the flavour was very different from any other Mexican dishes I have tried, and I actually did enjoy it, I just could not get over the intensity of the salt. 

The drinks and food at Pachuco's ranged from good to very good, and if they could tone down the salt (margaritas included), I would probably rate most of it as excellent. However, I cannot say our overall experience was excellent, but I would not fault them for it in my overall rating. Being that it was their opening weekend, one expects a few hiccups, and I am sure they will be cleared up by the time you visit. I was served the wrong meal at first, and we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for the Huitlacoche to be prepared, instead of the fish tacos, (though delightful looking), I was initially served. By the time my dish came around, the other half of our meal was cold. Our side plates and used cutlery were never removed from our table after we finished with our appetizers, and the tables are so small and cramped as it is, there was no room for our mains. Instead of removing our side plates, there was a vain attempt to stuff everything on the table. I eventually had to ask for fresh cutlery and removal of the used dishes from our table. Not once, but twice, we almost had our not-quite-finished drinks taken from us, and we had to ask a few times for extra tortillas. It seemed a little strange to me that you would only get four at a time, and as great as they were, they are very, very small, so I imagine each meal would require a minimum of 3 or 4 on its own. 

Overall, I think these are minor complaints, especially since it was Pachuco's opening preview. I found that the service was friendly and genuine, the restaurant was quaint and ambient, with Latin music, candles and a few kitschy décor details, which made it seem authentic and allow it to live up to it's self-proclaimed 'Modern Mexican' dining experience.",4,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.20000000298023224

I actually went out of my way to go to this place one day when I was craving some good-ole-fashioned-BBQ. Claiming to be serving it up in true Southern-style, I thought that there's no way this could go wrong. I've actually been to Texas and all throughout the Southern states on a fairly serious eating vacation, and lemme tell you something, The Drake and their lil' BBQ place owe the great state of Texas and its surrounding neighbours a serious apology...

Drake BBQ has a slew of great reviews all over the Internet. Everyone on Yelp, Twitter, and a bunch of TO food mags have been raving about the authentic, bad-ass Texas and Carolina style BBQ they've had in this place. I've read so many good comments, that I figured I must have gone to the wrong place. Maybe, I thought, there was some other place that just happens to look exactly the same, on the exact same street, with the exact same type of food?

Nope... I was in the right place. It just sucked is all.

Because they have such a loyal following, I'm sure quite a few people are going to dislike what I'm saying here, but in all honesty, if you got served what I did, you'd be disappointed too. My Carolina pulled-pork sandwich was small, dry, and amazingly enough, was completey void of BBQ sauce, which is a fairly important staple in a pulled-pork sandwich. They must have had some BBQ sauce somewhere in there, but if they did, they didn't offer it to me, and it certainly wasn't on my sandwich. My coleslaw was even worse. It was incredibly bland and wasn't much more than shredded cabbage with a slight trace of what I assume was salad dressing. Not to mention that this stuff was expensive! Two of those sandwiches and an itty-bitty coleslaw-plus tip of course-cost over 20 bucks.

Welcome to The Drake BBQ; it's BBQ with a side of pretentiousness. You don't like it? Trust me. If it's the same guy working behind the counter when I was there, then he won't care at all. I asked if we could get some fries with our sandwiches. he just looked at me, shocked, and said, 'I don't want a deep-fryer in this place'. Hey, I'm fine with the guy being pretentious and true to the stuff he's making and how he's making it, especially if it's honest-to-goodness Southern-style BBQ. If he truly was an artisan of the BBQ and the smoker, he can rightfully be as pretentious as he wants as far as I'm concerned. I probably would have answered back with an agreeing 'Yes Sir'! But the true kick-in-the-ass was that the stuff that I ended up taking home in a sad little brown bag was basically less than edible. In fact, I only took a few bites and ended up throwing it out, which is something I never, ever do. Someone went and filled thsi guy's head with the thought that this is actually what good BBQ is all about; someone lied to him.

Besides being about honest and delicious BBQ, the Southern states are all about hospitality and genuine people; people that would never be rude or unwelcoming. They're more likely to invite you in for dinner than they are to turn you away. Drake BBQ was none of those things. The service was rude, inhospitable, and unwelcoming. From the moment I walked in, I felt as though they wanted me the hell outta there. That is, except for the older guy that handed me the bag. He sent me off with a sincere sounding 'thanks for your business', which is something I think businesses don't say enough these days.

Like I said, this was painful for me. I felt ripped off. I felt sad. I felt let down. It was a just a plain bad experience that was nothing close to true Southern BBQ or Southern hospitality. In fact, I don't think I would even give it another go, and whether you've been exposed to true Southern BBQ or not, I'd suggest you don't either, because you'll feel let down either way too.",4,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-0.20000000298023224

Not only does it allow you to try more things on the menu, but it's also perfect for when you're  with a larger group. And that is just the reason why a couple of my friends and I headed to the Ossington area to try out Foxley, an Asian-Vietnamese inspired tapas house.

The restaurant ambiance doesn't mimic anything I typically associate with a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. It has a classier fine dining style of décor with ginger brick walls and soft lighting; it's a  perfect romantic date spot. In fact, we saw lots of couples there that night all dining on a few plates and enjoying wine.

My friends and I decided to follow suit, so we split a bottle of red and ordered the most interesting dishes that caught our eyes on the menu. This however, was a task easier said than done. The menu comes on a single-sided laminated sheet, with no pictures. It was hard to distinguish where the descriptions of one dish started and the next one ended. It felt a little like reading an essay! But once you get over the poor formatting, you'll be amazed by the variety of dishes that they offer. There is no shortage of exotic meats and dishes, like frog legs and beef hearts. But if you're not feeling that adventurous, rest assured they also do have many good old reliable classics, like deep fried shrimps, steamed mussels, and spring rolls.

The first dish that came was the Lamb and Duck Prosciutto Dumplings"" ($7). These were served hot,crunchy and  with jam packed with minced lamb stuffing. They're tasty, but nothing too special..

Next came a Sea Bream Creviche with Yuzu and Shiso ($15). They're bite sizes pieces of thinly sliced sea bream sashimi, covered with coriander and some lime puree. I actually found them to be a little too citrusy for my liking, but it is undeniably fresh. It was paired well with the crunchy fried onions generously sprinkled on top.

After that, a whole slew of dishes came at the same time, and it was difficult to figure out which one to dig into first; they all looked and smelled so appetizing! The Grilled Marinated Beef Short Ribs ($14) came on a small plate with about 3-4 pieces. A little too chewy for my liking, but it was at least well marinated and flavourful. In comparison, the Grilled Side Ribs with Caramelized Shallot Glaze ($9.00) were delicious. They were made up of two long pork ribs covered in a savory sweet glaze, with meat that fell right off the bone. We literally demolished that dish in a couple of seconds!

If you're a big fan of pork belly as I am, then you'll be in for a real treat at Foxley. They serve a Slow-braised Pork Belly in Muscatel Reduction ($15) with nicely marbled fat and cooked in a delicious smokey barbeque sauce ;it just melts in your mouth!

And while all those dishes were great, my favourite of the night was the Grilled Beef Heart with Chili Lime Salsa ($8). We ordered it just to try something new, and it was the best decision of the night! It came nicely grilled on two skewers so that the hearts are slightly charred on the outside for flavour, and still tender on the inside. Don't be afraid to try this one, it actually doesn't taste as farfetched as it sounds!

To balance out all the meat we ordered, the chef recommended the Kale Salad with Pecorino Toscano and Lemon Dressing ($8). I love kale, so in my books this salad was definitely a good order. My only complaint was that the lemon vinaigrette was a bit too sour.

Upon finishing up the meal, the first thought I had was that Foxley is not as ""Asian fusion"" as I had anticipated. There are some influences, but not nearly enough for me to notice the Asian aspect of the menu. That does not go to say that I didn't enjoy my meal though. While I found it was a little on the pricier side, I did enjoy the food and the romantically sophisticated atmosphere. Keep Foxley in your books for either your next date night venue or for a quiet relaxing dinner out with friends.",0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.30000001192092896

Their menu takes an exceptionally creative look at stuff you'd expect to find in the southern states with heavy concern for those that prefer meatless. Everything from Southern-fried chicken and Tenessee pulled pork sandwiches to grilled veg stew and fried tofu sandwiches. They also have a fairly original selection of sauces to dip your fries in that's worth mentioning. The staff are cool, layed-back, and they actually seem to care that you're there.

But like I said, all of that can change the next time you go in. Food could come out luke warm and greasy, staff could be stuck-up and simply not care.

It's an easy little place to overlook; it's just a small shop with little advertising way out on Queen East. But boy am I ever glad I stumbled onto this place. Hands down this was one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto. 

First off, it was actually cooked a little over medium-- without me asking! Truly a rarity nowadays, the guy at the counter told me they always cook it that temperature. Beautiful. Besides being cooked perfectly, the burger was served on a soft and slightly sweet bun that was matched perfectly with the savoury patty.

The fries are cut super skinny and fried crispy in-house. While that makes them perfect for eating right away, I do imagine that takeouters will find them soggy once they get to eat them. But for me, it was pure fry bliss.

The space is modern, clean, and stainless-steel heavy, but because of it's size, it only has seating for about 4 people. Once the place gets a lineup, which at peak times is completely inevitable, the seating area gets really cramped and is unpleasant to eat in.

Next time you happen out to the Beaches, definitely check this place out, or even if you're not in the neighbourhood, this place is totally worth the drive.

It has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent.  I chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons.  It checked a lot of boxes on my list.  I won't be going back.

This past weekend found me turning another year older, and because I've been experimenting with a gluten-reduced diet as of late, I decided my birthday dinner should be had at the Kensington Cornerstone.  I looked at pictures.  I perused the menu.  I read reviews.  It all seemed positive.

It was a beautiful evening, so I was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio.  We had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken, but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings, people watching (Kensington offers some of the best), and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street. 

Just when I was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables' pitcher of beer, our waitress appeared.  The up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals, so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time.  While we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria (and/or mojitos, and/or margaritas), we all ended up opting for beer.  My girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of Upper Canada Lager, while I decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections.  I figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop, so I stuck to my guns.  I've had what Nicklebrook has to offer in the line of GF beer, so I was looking forward to trying a new one.  I asked our server what the most popular one was, and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by La Messagre that operates out of Montreal.

When our drinks arrived, I took that first sip so full of hope, and for a split second I thought I was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend (I know, I'm nice aren't I?) that my beer didn't taste horrible.  I didn't have that chance.  Did I just drink beer?  Or did I just suck on a penny?  Even I was a bit confused at that point.  It started off so well, but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat.  Bitter...just like I was at that point.

So by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered.  Our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish.  Thank goodness our server was coming our way!  But instead of food, she came bearing bad news.  My girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out, and for some reason, they just thought to tell her now.  Not only would we have to wait even longer for our food, but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us. 

(Sound of clock ticking)

Another half hour passed and our meals finally arrived.  As hungry as I was I couldn't make it through my sandwich ($13).  It looked appetizing enough, but the pork wasn't nearly as tender as it should have been (I've been spoiled by the likes of Fidel Gastro lately), and the sauce was a bit of a turn-off, being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro.  The gluten free bread was quite good, and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice, so it was now more of a sponge.  Yes, a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy, but you should still be able to pick it up. 

My mom was impressed with her salmon ($18), but she wouldn't complain if there was a gun to her head.  It did look good though, and the portion was generous, so not all was lost.

Looking back on it now I wish I had just scrapped the GF diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant.  What was I thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner?  Why did I go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something I love on my special day?  Who does that?  So while I'm not taking the blame away from the restaurant, I will share some of it with them...but only some as the service was really what ruined our experience.  Maybe the food wasn't amazing, but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult.  The servers themselves were lovely girls, but somewhere back in the kitchen, the ball was dropped. 

After we begrudgingly paid our bill, I decided to throw the whole GF thing out the window and head to Ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note. As we sat there on the patio I couldn't help but stare across the road at The Grilled Cheese.  Oh, what could have been.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.0

My husband and I rescued Pepper and knew he was the dog for us despite the expected behavior problems coming from a rescued pup! She helped me identify the core of our issues with Pepper, and we faced them head-on! I had a perfectly behaved dog inside my apartment; sit, stay, free, park it (code for go lay down)- no problem! Our struggle was on walks and going anywhere. Pepper is an incredibly protective pup, and any dog or cat we saw, from any distance, would evoke jumping and barking which was incredibly impactful on our lifestyle. I had zero control over him outside of the apartment. Brenda taught me how to gain control outside of my home, and brought a variety of different dogs to increase Pepper's tolerance to dogs and to practice my new favorite term ""LEAVE IT!"". 

Long story short, we are still working everyday to improve Pepper's socialization, but we recently had a doggy play date and he did AMAZING! I can go on walks without an overwhelming feeling of panic, walk by cats without worry, and can even take the occasional hike when we know we only have to practice ""leave it"" a few times :) I am no longer afraid to take our dog for a long walk, or to bring him to new places!",2,xFxNZQYBVll1m12wmY-CpQ,0.4000000059604645

I  got home at 12 and called them and said where are my flowers?  The woman apologized and said that her supervisor would give me a call. Of course, no call. So, I called them yet again.

The answer was don't worry they'll be there.  They weren't.  Next morning my father waited at my house for the delivery of the missing flowers. Of course again no flowers.

Unassuming atmosphere, which I appreciate.  Generally, when I dine, I am looking for a food experience, espeically in this price-point.  They have a very limited wine list, and a very limited beer selection, no cocktails!  Which, again, is all fine... who can't enjoy a Tsing Tao?

We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a summer roll (special roll of the evening), and a crunchy roll.  My husband enjoyed all of them.  I, on the other hand, don't love spicy mayo on all of my rolls, so I enjoyed but did not love.  But, for the price, it is definitely worth a try.  I fear I have turned into a sushi snob :(

First off-- you do not come here for atmosphere.  They have gussied the place up a bit with some fake bamboo and updated posters on the walls.  The fact that you can see a run down laundromat and a car inspeciton station that may or may not be boarded up should not deter you from this spot.

They nonchalantly pointed to a section of clothes that she ""might"" like.  I inquired about help with sizing, to which, again, I was met with no offer of help.  She tried on a few things but she was frustrated with sizing and I was annoyed, so we left, empty handed.

The power classes that are offered after a hot class are little too hot, or I would give 5-stars.  Several times the classes that are advertised as ""in an 85 degree room"" have been in a 100 degree + room (I check the thermostat because I always wonder if something is wrong with me when my practice seems harder than normal!).  I have heard several people comment/complan about this issue.  Believe me, there is quite a difference between 85-87 degrees and 100 degrees!

This place is overflowing with friendly yogis.  My husband, who was really intimidated by the whole yoga thing, loves this place!  My top 2 studio in Charlotte.

The indoor pool area is great, with shower facilities and a locker room that are clean and a good temperature for freezing kids getting out of the pool.  The pool is an Olympic sized pool and is not kept freezing (like at MAC) but is cool enough for the children not to overheat.  The deep end has a ledge around the sides that the children can stand on while receiving instruction.  There are several diving blocks they practice on as well.  The seating is great... concrete bleacher-like seating that is in the pool area and divided by a smallish wall.  While the area does have a strong chlorine smell, it is nothing like other area YMCAs that have the indoor pools and water parks... my eyes do not sting while there nor do my clothes smell when we leave.  And, while it is warm in there (thank Goodness!), it is not sweltering.  The parking is awesome here.  There is never a crowd.

Ok, on to the instruction, which is great... I have enrolled a 4 year old and a 9 year old in this program.  My 4 year old could doggie paddle and swim just well enough to jump off the diving board, my 9 year old needed a refresher for the swim team and was mostly doing ""illegal"" strokes that would get her disqualified in a meet.  The lessons are at 6 week intervals, which is nice as really long-term commitments freak me out a bit (commitment phobe!).  They are so reasonably prices compared to what we have paid at the stand alone swim centers, I almost felt guilty.  This guilt increased when I found that my 9 year old was in a class with only one other child. The instructor was fantastic!  He pushed them enough to work hard but feel accomplished.  And he got her strokes totally straightened out (no more lifting her head to take a breath in freestyle).  We did 2 sessions (one 6 weeks, the other 5 weeks (even better for my commitment issues)), and my daughter ended up in the All Star swim meet after summer swim team.  Which was a bonus, I just did not want her to be embarrassed swimming.  The 4 year old?  After one 6 week session, she was doing a version of freestyle, jumping off the diving board and I felt totally safe letting her swim this summer without having to be in the pool with her at every moment.

I love sitting downstairs in one of the booths to the right of the hostess stand for a long leisurely lunch on a Saturday, that may, or may not, include a glass of wine.  I love coming here in the Fall and sitting outside, hearing the fountain and looking at the sheep statue.  I love coming here in the Winter and sitting in the really small and cozy booth in the main dining room.  Really, I cannot think of a time when it isn't right to come here!

The hummus plate is a delicious way to start your meal.  If you are lucky the white bean and gouda soup will be the daily soup offering.. it is bowl-licking good.  All the specials I have ever tried are delicious...  But, I tend to gravitate toward a salad or, my favorite, the black bean tortilla (with lots of fresh avacado!).  My hubbie likes the usual-- a grinder-ish type sandwich, the tuna, or whichever pasta is on the menu.

There is a special drink here called the ""Matilda Wong""  and it is very, very wong.  It used to come in a smallish fishbowl (think beta fish) but is now served in a small pitcher.

Ideally, the server should place the dish in front of the specific person who ordered it, or at the very least ask, ""Okay who ordered the so-and-so?"" and place it in front of whoever answers. Also, delivery should be simultaneous. Two of my friends got their dish, and me and the fourth friend waited 15 minutes after that for ours.

For $16.50, I received TWO beef ribs with barely any meat on them. In my opinion, ribs should be fall-off-the-bone. These were the exact opposite, and the flavour was nothing special. My friend was even more disappointed with his pork ribs, and sent them back in exchange for the pulled-pork sandwich.

First time in a very long while where I tipped less than 15%.",0,XLA3LkbfQfeA-VYO7Zgzyg,-0.20000000298023224

Their happy hour must be one of the best!  They have a list of items for $2.95.  Don't let the price fool you though.  Their portions are decent sized.  We always order one of everything, and maybe even two of some other things.  (Don't judge us!!)  How could you not though?  Cheap, good food is so hard to pass up!

One of the girls heard from some of her friends that this place was ""soooo good"".  Well, these friends of hers have either really low standards or just don't know the difference between good, quality food and junk.

All of us ordered the shoyu ribs ramen.  To say that it was disappointing would be an understatement.  The soup was luke-warm at best and it tasted almost sweet.  Ramen is supposed to be savory, so the sweet-ish soup was a major no-no.  The noodles were also sad.  It tasted like the instant stuff.  Gross.  Supposedly, their other menu items (i.e. gogi beef stuffed waffles) are supposed to be better, but that is a chance that I am not willing to take.

Their decorations/furnishings were quite interesting.  The first thing we noticed upon walking in was their Transformer-like chairs.  They had some anime characters painted on the wall and had some anime show/movie playing silently on a tv.  The place was insanely dark that we were blinded when we were walking outside to leave.  

It goes without saying that I definitely will not be going back.  I much rather eat Panda Express on campus.",4,EfOhaQ-J5s9t2EmH0uBELw,-0.10000000149011612

I love the FREE toppings you get which include grilled mushrooms and onions.  I always  order mine with extra mushrooms as I am a mushroom feign.  They also pile on the bacon which is awesome since most places gimp you on that.  Their bacon cheese dog is also delicious.  I just wish they had sport peppers.  Oh well, you can't win them all.  

Their cajun fries are also a must!  I'm not a big french fry fan (especially the thick cut kind), but the fries here are to die for!  The cajun fries are extra addicting (which is probably why they have such generous portions).

They have a variety of food and have choices available that aren't your typical buffet fare.  They also have a mac and cheese bar, which I loved since I am a mac and cheese feign.  I think the thing I enjoyed most was the desserts.  I'm not a big sweets person so I chose the French macaroons and the white chocolate dipped crab apples and strawberries.  However, for the people with a sweet tooth, they have a variety of gelato, fudge, cakes, and whatever else.  

Unfortunately, we've heard that the food isn't the same as it was before so we haven't been back.  They also raised their prices (it used to be $29, I think).  It's now $35, which is a bit steep if I'm not guaranteed amazing food.",1,EfOhaQ-J5s9t2EmH0uBELw,0.20000000298023224

I think the Cerreta family has put a lot of thought into the variety of their product offering and to ensure the highest quality of their ingredients. I feel that the candy itself is a testament to another time, the shape, size and taste transports me back to a time even before my youth.  I time I never knew but always imagined as better somehow.

Even though some of the presentation of the products and décor may seem dated, I sincerely feel that it is all part of the charm of this family owned business. I now live on the east coast, and try to swing by the store whenever I am in town to grab a box of French Mints for my office and get a few free samples while I'm there. It's always a hit with my co-workers. 

I also like picking up the individually wrapped candies, from time to time.  I find the factory store to have much more variety than the grocery store chains that also carry Cerreta's products around town. I have found this location to have a few more modern candy offerings, such as peanut butter truffle and mint cookie crumble.

She took her time to get me the the exact color I wanted, talked to me and offered me a drink.  I went in an hour before closing and the receptionist was afraid I wouldn't be able to squeeze in a pedicure, but Christina was fast and efficient to make sure I had enough time.

Only downside...the owner of the place was there today, and a bit standoffish.  I wouldn't say rude...but not friendly.  He interrupted my pedicure to have the lady check a yelp review (I'm assuming) because it was regarding a complaint and it was in a different language she could understand.  I didn't mind but it seemed unprofessional.  He kind of was staring at me, so I just said hello and he ignored me. :/ I would have given it five stars.

From the moment I saw the familiar ""Live"" sign appear in Liberty Village, I've been waiting. They opened in the week I was out of town visiting family, so for a week, I watched from a far, watching my friends post pictures of the various things they had bought, and ate,  looking forward to being back in my hood of Liberty/Niagara so I too could eat this stuff too.

Live Market is conveniently(?) located right near my gym, so I have been here three times in a fairly short time period, and it's nice to have such a great post-workout option, and really extra nice to have a close non-starbucks coffee/tea option near my house.

Both times I've actually ordered food, it's been very very tasty. First time - the chickpea burger, second time, upon the recommendation of the server - Burdock Burrito (Do order this. It is yummy.) Live Market also keeps me in Silk Road earl grey tea. I've had the wherewithal to arrive shortly before the influx of Liberty Village work folks coming in on their lunch break.

I often feel like the best way to tell the service level of a restaurant is how they handle minor errors. My partner ordered and ended up waiting a fairly long time for his lunch order, so not only did they make it right, they apologized, and offered him a coffee for his trouble. Smooth. Empowered staff make me a happy camper, so we just left liking them even more.

They've got Ezra Pound roasted coffee, and prepared ready-to-go items, juices, snacks, and treats, as well as order-in items if you have a little more time. 

There are lots of locally made products like ChocoSol chocolate, Stasis Preserves, Bunner's Cookies, Sweets from the Earth treats, amongst other things. You can buy protein powder, tea, coffee, and even make up. They also have jars of Rawtella for sale, which I wouldn't call ""healthy"", but I would call really really delicious (since I did end up buying some on my last visit...)

Service has been consistently friendly, food has been consistently good, and I feel like I get good value for my money when I go there.

Not because I particularly liked it, but because it was the main option for a slightly fancier totally vegan night out, with wine (the other tasty option being Vegetarian Haven, without wine.)

A group of 7 of us went on their second day. Is it too early to do a review? Maybe. So take it all with a grain of salt. I hear things are still ""evolving"" and the menu might change. More desserts might appear. Anything could happen. 

The Bar Snax menu looks interesting, and the idea of being able to have drinks and vegan snacks at midnight or 1 am, is promising, especially with Bar Chef next door (which has zero veganizable food options at all according to the last time we went...)

The Grasslands interior and drink menu is the biggest change when compared with Fressen. And those are really nice improvements. It's brighter, while still being intimate, and has a more open feel, with less cramped seating. 

Another pleasant change is that the servers all seem friendly, and generally helpful.

Food is very Fressen-like, so if you liked Fressen, you will like Grasslands. I had a favourite go-to dish at Fressen.  I ordered the skewer and liked it. Everyone else ordered the seitan roast or the chicken. Bar Snax menu is the biggest change from the former, and it's full of crispy and bite sized options.

Major problem on our first visit was that we went in a group of 7, which means an automatic gratuity of 18% was added to our bill. But there was nothing on the menu to indicate this, the person taking our reservation didn't let us know, and the servers didn't mention it. Since we're decent people, we obviously added a tip, and so, double tipped. Womp womp.

I'll leave out the Facebook page drama that ensued after we commented about it on their page, but regardless, they did not handle the comments well, and shut off posting on their page entirely. Hopefully it was an educational experience.

I wish they got their vegan baked goods from somewhere other than ""OMG Baked Goodness"" because I can't support that place at all. Please get some Sweets From the Earth!

But no, it was delicious and a great cozy cup of coffee (and now I kind of wish people always made me lattes with that heavy soy creamer...).

Wandering through their location is a bit like visiting a mini coffee museum.

I'd like to go back again and try just a regular coffee from Merchants of Green Coffee or take one of their coffee workshops after I've completed the rest of my Indie Coffee Passport Stops.",2,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ,0.0

Honestly, the store was a madhouse when I got in. There were over a dozen customers inside and 4-5 customer service agents in the store.

But, I waited only around five minutes to talk to someone, and in a little over 15 minutes I was set up with a new account, with the plan I wanted (at 50% off for 6 months) and a new phone (on WindTab). 

Daniel S was super helpful, gave me all the pertinent info I needed, answered my questions, and hooked me up with a phone number I might actually be able to remember. Everyone working in there seemed friendly and approachable, so that's a plus.

That is what customer service should be like. 

Overall, I was really satisfied with the customer service I recieved, and so far the coverage has not been an issue (for me). I haven't seen ""Wind AWAY"" at all yet.

And I ask... well is it vegan sour cream or cheese? to which she replies ""no it's not included"" (???) 

Dear restaurants, if you have something labelled ""vegan"" on the menu, could you let your staff know what ""vegan"" actually means? Thank you.

We waited about 20 minutes to get our orders. After I picked out the big tasteless spears of tofu out of my not so juicy  ""Juicy Vegan"" it wasn't so bad. I liked the diversity of vegetables, it was an ok size, but I'd probably opt for Big Fat Burrito or Burrito Boyz instead of going to this place again.

There are adequate outlets (well... okay there are six, and I got one, so for me, that's adequate)  for us computer folks, fast free wifi and places to sit.

Fried tofu gluten fritters with carrots, potatoes, beans and cauliflower sounded so yummy but it wasn't.

The only thing I really enjoyed the flavour of was the potatoes, because they seemed to have taken on the most of the curry flavour, the veggies and soy/gluten stuff weren't very flavourful. I needed some hot sauce for sure.

The drop-in dinners are usually why we end up there once a week (or more) whenever they have a vegan one (which is on the regular.) It's always something different, but it has been consistently delicious. The chef stylings of Len (who I think is the owner) cooking something up every Tuesday, Emily Z, or Kalmplex (and many others) make this place just a total hidden gem (that I kind of don't want to tell anyone about, because I want to keep it to myself.)

As people have mentioned, sign up for the newsletter on their website (or connect with them on facebook/twitter) to keep up with the events they have going on, there is always something for everyone. 

The house made sodas are totally delicious (elderberry, blackcurrent, maple lemonade, just to name a few), they also have coffee/tea, apple cider, and soy milks.

Clean lines, hyper modern rooms with a split shower, where, if an interested party wanted to voyeristically watch you bathe, they could do so, while laying on a very comfortable bed. And if you aren't so keen on goose down, they have alternate bedding available upon request.

I've been getting a few questions about the process so I figured it would be helpful to have some idea of what happens when you walk in.

So this is what happens when you walk in.

I had already paid and made my appointment online, so I just walked in around 15 minutes before my appointment. I signed a release form, drank some tea, and waited until my turn came. A friendly member of the staff showed me to the room I would be using, explained a bit about the tank, and some advice on ear plugs, then he left me alone to do my thing. 

The doors lock, so you have some privacy.

I had the last float of the night, so it was 2 hours long, but standard floats during the day are around 1 hour.  They have 5 rooms, each with flotation tanks in them, and it's easy to make an appointment online, which was a major plus.

Each room has a shower, a bench, and a flotation tank, and a robe. Towels & ear plugs are also provided. They have scent pre-float shampoo & body wash you can use to get ready before going into the tank, and a more scented post-float shampoo and conditioner.

The flotation tank has about 10 inches of water, and a whole bunch of dissolved salts (for max float potential), so it's easy to get into the tank, sit on the bottom, close the door, lay in the water, and then open it again, or whatever you feel comfortable with. 

At first I was a little anxious about getting lost into the abyss of the tank, and it just seemed to get darker, but as I found out, it's easy to find the door handle in the dark, and easy to open it whenever you need to. So after realizing it wasn't a big deal, and that I could open the door anytime, I closed the door, and floated away 2 hours without realizing it.

When your time is up, there is music that comes on, and gets progressively louder to gently wake you or get you out of your relaxed state.

There is no right way to do it, but I had a great time just floating around with my eyes open, enjoying the feeling of gravity mostly disappear, and also got some really good stretching in as well. Just be careful with the salt water, as you might expect, if you get it in your eyes - it stings! (but there is a towel with a water bottle near the tank door if you need to rinse)

There was only a brief moment in the beginning of my float when I heard a siren from the street, otherwise, I didn't notice any street noise at all, and considering what I saw when I left Float last night, that's really impressive (lots of police activity, another ambulance that I hadn't heard). I'm usually pretty sensitive to sound, so mostly for me it was nice to have some near-total quiet and no vibrations other than the sound of my heartbeat for a couple of hours.

I think they've got a great set up, and I didn't find their prices high (especially when compared with some other float places I've seen in the past) and they've got a variety of options to choose from on their website. 

The one thing that is worth mentioning, is that after floating and being relaxed and blissed out, walking out onto Queen Street at 1 am on a Friday night can be kind of shocking (not like this is a surprise of course, it's loud, and busy). I know I'd like to try and do a late night 2 hour float during the week next time. Otherwise, I had a really great time.",9,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ,0.30000001192092896

First thing Saturday morning, I went over there to meet up with Nicole H. for a minicoffee crawl.

I got there way too early, but the moment I walked in, I instantly felt comfortable and welcome. It's the kind of place I could see myself visiting everyday for a coffee. Very friendly atmosphere, the lighting was great, and there was ample seating (but of course,  it was 10am on a Saturday morning). It was obvious this was a local spot, people coming in and out, chatting with Bob (the owner) like he was an old friend. 

I ordered my usual large soy latte. It was so good. Thick, with a cute three dimensional heart made of crema. And I just loved the cup. I commented on it in my head and then again to Nicole H when she got there. It was the perfect size and shape to hold with both of my hands. Also, I was very happy to see they don't charge extra for soy milk!

Other things that are great: 
- They have free wifi (when I went in, the password was on the chalkboard at the front)

I like that there is always a bottle of water on the table, because I end up getting a couple litres of my H2O intake for the day while I'm there.

I've ordered a bunch of different things, but the Pad Thai was easily (and most expensively)  my favourite. Nice filling serving, with a fresh rich flavour.

The nacho plate is pretty delicious too, but as some other reviewers have mentioned, don't expect a giant nacho plate portion here. It's not huge, but paired with a meal it's a nice snack.

Smoothies are always thinner than I expect them to be (and after ordering it several times you'd think I'd be used to it by now, but I'm not) so that's something to be aware of and set less thick mouthfeel expectations.

The veggie wrap normally has brie in it, and jut as a heads up, one of the unlisted additions is mayo... so you know if you're vegan, ask for it without, or just skip it and just opt for soup. (or go somewhere else.) The wrap came with a tiny salad, that of course, had ""just a little bit"" of mayo on it, I guess ""a little bit"" of mayo is the same as ""no mayo""? Not quite.

My friend had the wrap and the Porcini Mushroom Soup and loved it. It's based on an onion broth, and has mushrooms, barley, and truffle oil in it, so it's actually vegan. However, soups all come with a cheese biscuit.

We ordered edamame as an appetizer and a few orders of cucumber and avocado maki. Well, we got our maki first, and it was good. It was a bit on the big side and loosely wrapped, but on the bright side, the avocado and cucumber were fresh. The edamame appeared after we had finished about half of the maki.

The service was friendly and we got our order quickly, but at the end of the meal we waited about ten minutes for a bill. Every moment one of the staff would go by we'd try and wave at them, but they'd come rushing past us. 

Overall it was okay. It's a decent spot to go before a movie, but I probably wouldn't seek it out on at any other time.",2,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ,0.30000001192092896

The staff are friendly and helpful, the trainers were friendly, there are loads of treadmills, elliptical machines, bikes and equipment. Some old, some new. The best part about it, is that it is nearly empty.

I think the biggest selling point for me is that it has great change room facilities and amenities. Unlike the Liberty Village location (that is now my regular location), there isn't a mass veto on scented products, and they have lotions, different shampoos, hair spray, gel, deodorant, etc. There is a hot tub, sauna and steam room, and more than enough showers.

We ordered Chef Susur's famous signature dish, the Singaporean-style slaw ($20) and added tuna sashimi ($10). This slaw was very good. There are so many ingredients but they work well together and it was refreshing and light. 

The tuna sashimi was smoked on the outside and it didn't really add any flavour so I would probably skip that. The tuna does add a contrasting texture to the crunchy slaw. I arrived hungry and felt full after eating half of this dish.

Note: there are peanuts. 

2) Peking & Char Sui Duck ($29): Beijing duck garnish, steamed pancake, foie gras pâté

However, I must say, Andy is the man. How can you go wrong with a take-out only sushi restaurant inside the largest fresh fish market in town (Wholey's)? Especially in a town like Pittsburgh which doesn't come to mind when you think fresh sushi.

I've had my fair share of nasty fish around town. Even in some nice places that looked like the fish should have tasted better (and fresher) than it was. Then I found Andy. No frills, no bar, but hey, the fish is as fresh as you're gonna get in these parts of the USA.

People seem to line-up for his endless list of rolls - and there are plenty. I never got why someone would order a Fried Chicken Roll. Personally, I prefer the lunch special which includes 8 pieces of nigiri sushi (whatever is fresh that day....usually yellowtail, tuna, salmon and eel), as well as eight pieces of some roll Andy throws together in front of you - like a spicy California Roll or Salmon and Cucumber Roll. You get what he thinks is the freshest catch of the day. Total is around $14.00 for this particular order.

And one other word of caution, especially around holidays and on Fridays, Wholey's can be jammed with people - I mean packed - so if you don't like crowds, or if you don't like standing in line to order your food and watch Andy make it fresh - then CALL AHEAD and place your order for pick-up.

I like that incoming livestock are kept in quarantine after arriving, that I can ask to be told when a particular species becomes available, that the staff are so knowledgeable and enjoy discussing the hobby, even though I notice some impatient shoppers just wanting to grab and go. 

Reminds me of the now closed Pirrhana on Avenue Road that was run by a hobbyist, or Fintastic in the east end run by Mike.

Harold the head guy has saved a couple ailing fish with clear advice.

Just in case this seems too high a rating, keep in mind that I have seen a lot of fish shops since I began the hobby sixty years ago.

It starts with brilliant pho broth: here is a very complex , low salt highly complex broth . It reminds me of the broth used by the sadly gone White Lotus on Lansdowne that was my flagship spot  for excellence until it closed about three years ago.
Anyway hooray for excellent golden turtle broth. I had the soup last time which brought me back today.

I tend to evaluate using two or three standard dishes and today it was vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and spring rolls. Verdict: massive shrimp lightly grilled, lots of tender pork and as in earlier visits very plump non- greasy spring rolls which I dipped in Hoisen sauce as an experiment.

My bowl of Bun had lots of mint and bean sprouts, and the accompanying sauce was not too vinegary all well balanced.

Overall extremely satisfying and served up with flair and professional skill in a very busy lunch hour.

Chicken and Waffles : portion is not worth it flavor was alright nothing mind blowing (go to the Kensington market one ... WAYYY better and much more for your money) 
 
Red Funnel cake : save your money .... Tiny over cooked and completely over drizzled with icing ... Yuck  worst thing I have ever had in the funnel cake department.

Blanco roll was the worst..  it's like someone squished egg, tuna from a can and panko crumbs and made it a roll.... As if that's not bad enough they make it resemble some back ally hotdog by adding pickled jalapeño to it.... Gross if you like fish cakes and hotdogs this roll is for you. If not I highly recommend staying away. 

If they made it simple with avocado raw fish and other non over powering tastes then sliced raw jalapeño over it then torched the butter fish it would probably be the best sushi roll here. 

Volcano roll was okay but really over done with the sauce quantity which took away from enjoying fish ... Which is why I go out for sushi. 

The sashimi plater (30 pieces) was pretty bad aside from the octopus and 3 of the 9 cuts of salmon.... Everything else was off temperature. 

Complimentary salad was small cute and good. 

The miso soup was good. 

Tea was average. 

Ginger is really good here.

Wasabi is really weak here.

Some of the desserts are really over priced for the quality and quantity you are getting (i.e. Small Almond croissant $4.20)

I originally had an amaZing tattoo artist in Kensington (Vince) who unfortunately moved back to Venice, Italy. Fate brought me to the hands of the very talented RAIDEL! 

His passion for creative designs and art is phenomenal! He has done quite a large AMAZING piece on me and most of it he just did FREEHAND  (That is talent!)  

The thing I LOVE the MOST about his many talents is the fact that he has something that I find is SO RARE in a tattoo artist... he can create that FLOW into making your tattoo not look like a stamp ... but a part of you... an art that can even take previous pieces and make them one! I have about 1 3rd or fourth of my body tattooed and this tattoo SAVIOUR turned my several prior tattoo pieces (ribs, shoulders upper back) and with his new addition turned my body into a canvas with one solid flowing united piece. Brilliant engineer in designing.     

Adrenaline is quite pricey ..but if you are getting it done with him IT'S WELL WORTH IT. If I wasn't so broke ass I would give him a HUGE TIP as appreciation for his VERY hard work and TALENT!

The bad - the younger lady who served us seemed like she does not like her job ... She made our visit unpleasant right from the entrance ... She seemed a little arrogant too.... And was not very familiar with the desserts. 
I am not a fan of lemon desserts but I do not mind something with a tiny note of it (as I know a lot of baked desserts often do have a little in them) ... When I specifically asked for her recommendation she gave me an extremely lemony dessert. I also requested a no foam latte and she seemed to also miss that one as she handed me something that closely resembled a cappuccino. 

I love the heart of this place ... It was actually a bit heart breaking with my last visit as I have come in several times throughout the past couple years and have not received this type of treatment. 

The good- Love the desserts here I usually always grab a mix box of the traditional southern Italian almond and pistachio biscuits and am always very pleased with the texture, the flavour and the combination of them! 
The bread here is amazing highly recommend you try anyone of them (I am sure you will love it! ) 

The coffee beans they use here are also very robust and strong which I love.


I try to ignore the treatment I got here last time .....because maybe she was just having a bad day and was taking it out on us .....but to be honest that's no excuse, ever ...

Fish taco was great and flaky 

They had a Trout taco day feature which was great (with a little lime and hot sauce)

Chicken and beef tacos had a decent amount of meat in them and were nicely cooked and shredded. 

The Vegetarian option was surprisingly also very tasty and flavourful 


Ceviche love the jalapeño touch inside but fish and tomatoes needs to be chopped up more for better chip grabbing fun.

The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  

To be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would ""incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes""--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue ""fighting"".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. 

If this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. 

In short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.  I'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one I had in a large group.",1,TVvTtXwPXsvrg2KJGoOUTg,0.0

The waitress was sweet. But the manager ignored us and went for the people who looked like they had more money to spend and talked to them about the variety of wines. 

There was a sign when I came in that said something like no hats allowed or take off your hats. That was fine with me but a bit taken aback by that sign which kind of set the negative tone in a sense.

1) I suffered a CTD / RSI hand/wrist injury due to my profession.  Rehabilitation doctors are not trained to detect minor amounts of inflammation and use a pain scale of 1-10 to quantify a patient's condition, or use expensive and uncomfortable diagnostic tests.  For a minor inflammatory condition, hand therapy and anti-inflammatory medicines were the prescribed course of action.  Unfortunately, a minor onset of more inflammation from overuse is not detectable by the hand therapist either, who is also trained with the pain scale.  Dr. Xiao is an expert detecting minor amounts of inflammation and could identify both where and how I sustained it.  She used a combination of deep tissue diagnosis and healing massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture to remove the inflammation.  

Now, I am working with both Dr. Xiao and the hand therapist to build muscle and function.  I have regained a tremendous amount of strength and am well on the way towards a full recovery.

2) I had a persistent skin irritation lasting over a year that my dermatologist could not identify and prescribed steriodal creams for.  Dr. Xiao recognized it right away as an energy imbalance in the liver channel.  She used a combination of herbal remedies and acupuncture and cleared it away permanently after 4 months of treatments.

She is easily one of the best diagnosticians and practitioners that I have ever met, and she truly loves her work.  I cannot say enough about how she has dramatically improved my life.",3,vc-VfW7-Q7JmHzA6bTLHyA,0.10000000149011612

It does NOT get much worse than these guys.  First... a little background, I have never gone out of my way to complain about a company.  If you see my other reviews, you'll notice I go out of my way to rave about companies on here.  There's only 1 other negative review in my portfolio, and even that company is 4 stars compared to crappy old Appliance Certified.  

I used these guys about a year ago, and the guy that came over was cool and the price was reasonable.  So I actually referred them to about 3 people since and kept their magnet on my fridge. 

However, last week my sink started leaking and we were unable to use it anymore until fixed.  I called this company right away (Thursday) to book appt for the next day (Friday).  No call... no show.  I called back later in the day simply to leave a voicemail.  Saturday I called back and they said they'd have someone out Monday (after apologizing).  Monday came... no call... no show.  Typically, I know you should give up on a poor company like this.  But, I decided to give them one more chance.  Called Tuesday, and set up for today because I had a busy week and couldn't do it until that Friday.  Next Friday came, they called me at 9am to confirm.  Whew... then... didn't show.  1pm I called them and a woman said she'd get on the phone with dispatcher and call me back right away with an ETA.  3 hours later... no call... no show.  I called now twice only to leave another message. 

Bottom line:  This company shouldn't even be called a company.  The suck.  My 5 year old son is more responsible and considerate. If I had nothing else to do today, I would create 3 more Yelp accounts just so I can complain 3 more times.  One for every time they messed up.",7,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,-0.10000000149011612

I also enjoy the towel service. & The equipment is great. The classes seem great though I have yet to attend a class. 

But I wish the gym would add free wifi for members to use while working out (so that I can watch netflix while working out), add some more channels to the equipment's tvs (I wish they would add e, bravo, mtv) and add a laundry shoot for towels inside the locker rooms. I even put in a request for the laundry shoot but Mountainside obviously just ignored my request. 

I also wish this location & all other locations would have a water service that they provide in their Scottsdale location. It seems like the west valley is constantly getting the short end of the stick and this is another example of that isn't it? & might be wrong but I think the Scottsdale location also has better tv channels than the Surprise gym does.

But you really need to order the all you can eat because the portions on the plate of meat are too little for the amount you're paying.  The all you can eat is around $25 / person & everyone at your table has to eat all you can eat or no one can order it. If you order the all you can eat then you don't have to pay extra for rice (which you really shouldn't have to do if you put in an order for meat--but that's just my opinion).

Seoul Grill recently revised their menu, so there are more options for different meats. They have added different flavors, which are so yummy! Try to spicy pork belly (sam gyop sal) that was recently added it's one of my favorites.

And remember when eating meat first order not marinated meats then order marinated because otherwise the marinated meats taste will disrupt the taste of the not marinated meat.

After getting my hair burned last year & then finding out that Hair City in Phoenix closed I wasn't sure where to go to get my hair magic straightened. I even debated driving out to LA to get my hair done in Koreatown.

But luckily I received a referral to Cleo's from a Korean restaurant and so I went here and am glad I did!

I got my hair magic straightened (aka japanese straightened) and the stylist did a great job. Although my hair didn't come out perfectly, I blame myself because I recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair. And bleach plus magic will frizz hair. I learned this from the stylist at Cleo.

I have to give extra credit to the stylist at Cleo, because he kept asking me if I had used bleach in my hair for highlights. And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.)

I also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year)

Go here get your hair done by an expert. He told me he was trained in both Korea & Japan. So he speaks Korean, Japanese, & English. 

I believe magic straight costs about $150, at least that's what I paid. And digital perm costs around $130",13,WgbbxTRIy7MwDKn7nL5WKQ,0.0

Anyway, I received a white tip pedi from a new tech (female).  She did not paint even  lines.  And when I looked at my toes the lines were a mess and did not match one another.  Some were lower, some were shorter.  It's hard to explain but  my toes did not resemble one another.  I asked if she could fix the lines.  And she had to redo the lines and still couldn't get it right.

Look, getting a pedicure is a service and I want it to look nice.  And the fact I'm paying extra for the white tip... I feel like they should get it right.

I've been getting pedicures for years and have never complained.  

Anyway, it was obvious I wasn't happy, the manager(?) Kevin came and looked at my pedi and told me it looked fine to him.  They know me at this salon.  I think even if they thought I was imagining the concerns (which I was not) I think they should have had another tech redraw the lines or comp something to make me feel valued.  Instead they made me feel worthless as a customer by telling me there was nothing wrong.

So I got upset, passed on the manicure, paid for the pedicure and left.

They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!!

General
- Bad ventilation. With Pittsburgh humidity, it gets hot.
- Wooden walls, so there's not a lot of grip for smearing
= Price for a day pass is reasonable, but fees for little things like a belay device and chalk add up instead of holding an id for collateral.

Bouldering area
+ Decent number of routes and variety
- Stiff trampoline floor. Movable pads are big and effective but they aren't everywhere

Top rope area
-The top rope area is a different section of the building and even has different hours from the bouldering area, which is weird.
- Ratings are labeled as Easy, Moderate, and Hard with +/-. Why not put real YDS ratings?
- For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before.
- Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.  Discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in San Francisco where I live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating.",3,onagImY8qLOyRGEymXcmRw,0.0

We got to meet our tour guide as well who gave us a quick background on the non-profit organisation behind the museum - it's great to see such a dedicated group of people preserving what some people would just treat as junk.

It's an amazing collection of old signage and as part of the tour around the 'boneyard' the guide gave us some great (and humorous) history about Las Vegas.
 This really made the tour as there was so much we learnt at the same time and it was astonishing to learn just how much the city has changed.

Well, add to all of that, that the food is delicious. Maizal is a recent addition to the Liberty Village area. They have vegan and gluten-free options in addition to non-vegan/veg ones.

The menu is short and simple. At the moment, the vegan options are: grilled quesadillas sin queso (ask for no cheese/dairy) with either poblano peppers or mushrooms, the sopes with black beans, tlacoyos (bean filled tortillas), and opales (cactus.) All very yummy sounding options. Their tortillas are entirely corn based (and gluten-free) and made fresh every morning. (they also happen to be delicious.)

Other things on the menu I should mention: the horchata. Traditionally milk-less, it's rice based at Maizal, with a cinnamon spice, and perfectly ice cold. 

Outdoor patio space is out front on Jefferson, and small but decent. Interior space is ample, but I imagine it's going to be an area lunch time takeout place pleaser, a tasty, healthy meal for under ten dollars. If you sit in like we did, you can read about the history and cultivation of corn on the very aesthetically pleasing chalkboards (and no joke, it really is interesting.) And let me say it again: Air Conditioning.

We each ordered 2 grilled quesadillas sin-queso (no cheese.) We sat sipping on horchata's while we waited and enjoyed the corn diagrams. They arrived, with pico de gallo on shredded lettuce, and a side of refried beans.  One poblano pepper and one mushroom. One bite and I've decided these tortillas are made of tasty magic. That one bite was all tortilla, and it was so rich in maizey-flavour and texturally superior to nearly all other tortillas I've had up until now (so I eat a lot of tacos...)

The fillings for both were great, both hearty and satisfying with rich savory flavours. Add some of the pico and a touch of lettuce and it is perfection. The folks at Maizal are doing exciting things with food, and I'm looking forward to seeing more, and eating much more from them.

It was a beautiful looking cup of coffee, but it may have also been the worst almond latte I've ever drank. I think it's great that they offer almond milk, but I'm not convinced they knew how to use it that day. Overall... my problem was that the coffee was very bitter. Way too bitter.

Since it was the end of the day, they had already run out of many of their sweet baked treats (even after apparently baking 3 day's worth of things) but I grabbed a vanilla cupcake with butter cream frosting, a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and a gluten free butter tart (and a non gluten free butter tart). They were all delicious. The cupcake was spongy and fluffy, the icing sweet, whipped, and not stiff at all. I was especially partial to the GF butter tart.

Friendly service, and great interior design. I loved the overhead lights - they're freaking lamps made from giant beaters, plus every table had fresh flowers on it. One word sums this place up -  adorable. (In two words - adorably delicious.) I love the random jars with stuff in it aesthetic. Lots of greens and neutral tones.

Taking a bite out of one of their fresh lime coconut donuts makes me want to write poetry, but it looks like another reviewer has taken care of that.

So what can I say, I haven't eaten anything here I didn't like. The tacos are all delicious (though my favourite is the Yuba), and an order of nachos is filling and flavourful with spiced beans, cashew cream cheese, some kind of cheese sauce and veggies. I've been eyeing those burritos, but haven't gotten around to ordering one yet.

I'm happy to see a couple of different hot sauces on the side bench, along with a help yourself collection of water jugs. You might notice the lack of garbage can, well, everything is biodegradable. Which is awesome, but I can't help but be compelled to bring along a reusable container with me so I don't waste any more paper bags on donuts I inhale in 5 minutes anyway.

The limeade can be a bit too heavy on the agave sometimes, but otherwise I have no serious complaints. Service depends on the day and who's at the counter, but it's usually somewhere between decent and awesome.

The seating is limited to about 9-12 people depending on where you're sitting, but it hasn't felt crowded any of the (several several several) times I've gone in. There is a lot of foot traffic, people running in and out to grab a quick bite. 

The simplicity of their menu and pricing scheme is appreciated, just enough choice, without too much choice. What you see on the board, is what you will pay (tax is included), and combining donuts and tacos or beverages results in a nice round number which nutty folks like me will appreciate.

I haven't checked them out for breakfast on the weekends, but it's definitely on my to do list. Breakfast burritos... tempting, tempting.

Not just hey they'll bring me my order the way I asked for it, but they'll do that AND be friendly, helpful, and fast. Service is great, they have on repeat occasions gone out of their way to be accommodating (without attitude).

A big one for me is they are vegan friendly (including the best most delicious vegan caesars in town) with most brunch items available veganized (and like every other brunch place they are omnivore and lacto-ovo-vegetarian friendly too,) you sit where you want, you can play board games if you want, you can drink bottomless coffee with your brunch if you want, you can ask for their fancy cocktail menu (yes, they have one), or just check out what's on offer to drink on the chalkboard.

I'll also say, that the food is okay. Tofu scramble is hit or miss, but usually it's decent enough that even on it's worse. I've had worse tofu scrambles at places catering to vegetarians, so there is that.

I've gone with friends, I've gone with family, I've gone in pairs, I've gone in big groups. Go for brunch. It's great. Go for drinks, it's fun.

I got a vegan burrito and didn't feel deprived of anything, it was a nice big meal. I really liked how they constructed it. It made a huge difference when biting in. There was an intermingling of flavours rather then the usual ""oh here's rice, oh here's lettuce, oh here's salsa""  feeling I get from some other places. It was quite filling, though I probably could have eaten two for lunch. I think grilling the burrito is a nice touch, crispy on the outside warm and yummy on the inside. 

They have veggie ground round, and vegan guacamole, and hot sauce that's actually hot. I wish they also had some daiya, because that would have made this place all around perfect.

The food could be spicier, but that seems pretty standard in this city and nothing a bit of hot sauce can't fix.

My delivery experiences have varied. When I order things through Order-It or Just Eat,  the resulting delivery takes forever, there are often issues with our order (like egg in the pad thai when we specifically said vegan/no egg), and the prices are more expensive than just ordering directly.

I ordered the ""First Canadian"" , and while I've often felt really bored with bowls of vegetables/grains/etc, this one was a great mix of ingredients - tempeh, quinoa,  shredded red and green cabbage, sweet potato, and a flavourful dressing on the side.

They've got a decent selection of milks (soy, almond, coconut, and  rice) for prepared coffee drinks like cappuccino, lattes, etc.  and fresh juices.

We started things off with an order of crispy oyster mushrooms and seared dumplings. I wish we had ordered two orders of the crispy oyster mushrooms because I can never have enough, they are so rich and flavourful and the sweet slightly spiced sauce is a perfect compliment for it.

We both ordered the Special of the Day, which was a tofu skin wrapped taro root mash on a bed of greens, with a side of noodles, and a flavour explosion of a mango salad. 

Our waitress totally sold it. Her description got my mouth watering from the very beginning. It adds so much to a meal when the server is friendly, and she was wonderful. Moreover, she clearly loved the place and the food, which is exactly the type of person I want advising me on what to order.

The chocolate cake was good, but not as good as the sundae. Though I'm glad our server made sure we took the left over chocolate cake home, because while it wasn't as awesome when it went head to head with the sundae, it was fantastic by itself at 3am.

They've got a variety of kombuchas, teas, blue sky soda, and assorted bottled fruit juices, in addition to fancy (and more regular) coffee options. 

I hear there is a menu extension coming in September with sandwiches and the like coming soon, so I'm pretty excited to check that out too when it appears.

I'd recommend the vegetable samosas instead (or get the spicy lentils as a veg dish for a closer to normal level of spice.) They do bake them - so they aren't deliciously deep fried, but still the filling is nice.

Oats, melty chocolate chips, dried cranberries and a few other things combined into a soft chewy cookie. I want to go back, right now, and get another one.

I should probably mention that in my experience gluten free tends to secretly mean gross, and I have been known to occasionally thank my body for not having celiac disease. So what I'm saying when I say this place is good, is that it's not just gluten-free good. It's actually good.

When I went in today there were cupcakes (three different kinds: vanilla, chocolate and red velvet), DONUTS, amazingly yummy cookies (gypsy cookie), freshly baked loaves of bread (which I'm kicking myself for not trying), muffins, and cookie sandwiches!

What I'm going to hope for is that every coffee shop in town starts using them as their source for vegan (and/or gluten free) treats. While they have decent enough coffee (and Silk Soy creamer is available), I sure wouldn't mind having one of their cookies or muffins with a nice soy latte. (Of course... Crema Coffee is just across the street...)",14,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ,0.30000001192092896

So lovely. I can't wait to keep going back.

As an added bonus, since they only recently took over that location they are part of the Indie Coffee Passport less-than-3 Edition, so you can give them a try, while taking advantage of a really great deal.

Now, you'll see it in a sweet location in the Annex.

Full disclosure: I've been excited about this bakery opening for months, and I don't care who knows it. I have wanted a source for a steady supply of vegan magic squares, and now I have one (p.s. get the magic squares)

I had the opportunity to visit the bakery during the sneak-peak opening in December, and bought magic squares (but not enough), a cookie, and a couple of candied apples and it felt like early Xmas.

Then I waited (im)patiently for their opening this month. And today I braved the snow and went in. I left with dark chocolate croissants, magic squares (obviously), and a pot pie. My partner came home with croissants, a couple of sausage rolls and a whoopie pie. Yes, we're getting ready to hibernate this weekend.

The croissants are ridiculously flaky, the magic squares are incredible as usual, I haven't eaten anything else yet, but I've sort of come to expect that anything from APiecalypse Now! will be really good.

In the fridge & freezer so far they've got (all of these things are vegan): cashew ricotta, Caesar salad dressing, flavoured butters, lasagna, pot pies, shepherd pie, gluten free and gluten-full chili mac, potato salad, tzatziki, tartar sauce, Northwood Cold Brew Coffee (which I'm drinking right now - tasty), and more.

I like that there appears to be a sincere effort made to find ethical, ecologically sound, and human friendly products to make & bake stuff, and that they have compostable packaging.

Service was friendly and fast & they take cash, credit, and debit.

There is no seating inside, so prepare to take out.

P.S. try the magic squares.",6,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ,0.30000001192092896

I spent a considerable amount of time visualizing how they could fit more tables in without getting to crowded, and I can see why they set it up the way they did.

I love the space. Floor to ceiling windows facing Queen St and the rest is brick. High ceilings, ample bookshelves and the random old stove in the center... it just works.

I ordered a soy latte, and it was delicious, not too bitter, not too boring. Foam was nice and thick (but not too much) Just right. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have any ""to stay"" cups. But on the plus side, they've got free wifi and they don't charge extra for soy milk.

One thing I find really cool about Ground Level is that it operates as part of Ground Level Youth Ventures where youth learn life skills and job training (beyond just making coffee). Definitely something I'm into supporting.

The space is really clean and relaxing, there is seating for about 4 people, but like I said, it's styled as a take-out place (so you know, you could hypothetically take stuff out, and eat in the park.)

I was oversold on the 20$ gift card. I like going out for coffee because it's relaxing - I didn't expect to have to say ""no not interested"" to some pseudo promotion (gift card - meh) repeatedly.

Everyone is generally nice, respectful of space, and you know, no one is ever doing bicep curls in the squat rack.

I still haven't convinced myself to go on a repeat visit to any of the 6am classes, but they exist for those pre-work workout fiends. I'm just too much of a night owl. I'm also lazy.

Classes to chose from include yoga classes, Pilates, boxing, kettle bell workouts, spinning, crossfit, and a whole bunch of others. Lots of elliptical machines, 5-6 treadmills, and bikes. They also have a decent variety of weight machines, free weights, and other equipment to play with.

There is one personal trainer that without fail will change the music station from some amazing techno/dub/remix (you know, perfect workout music) to some weird classic rock/easy listening/crud, so word of advice - bring some headphones if you're going in the middle of the day. The weekend hours are not as convenient (they close at 6ish), but I do like that they're open later than most gyms on Fridays.

One other thing I like is that they have other sport related services available on site. In addition to personal trainers, there are chiropractors, RMTs, a holistic nutritionist, and an ND. It's nice to have the option of just going in, working out, seeing an RMT, or someone else, and going home.

It's clean, friendly, and welcoming. There is a free week trial, and I'd totally recommend you try it out. But only if you're awesome.

After looking at the menu board, I filled out the custom order form (and there were LOTS of options to choose from.) s  and handed it to the nice server informing everyone that the debit machine wasn't working. (right at noon time! what terrible timing!)

I got the spinach wrap, grilled and filled with veggies, with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Can't go wrong with that combo. It was warm and fast. Even though there wasn't much reason to (nothing to melt, nothing needed to be cooked) I'm glad I got it grilled. It seemed to help keep the wrap together as I was running down Bloor.

If you don't feel like making up a meal for yourself they also have a huge selection of ""Chef Creations"" (at least one of which is vegan)  that you can modify further if you feel like it (for an extra charge).

The other benefit to this location is that Crema Coffee is right inside, so you can get a wrap, salad, bowl, or whatever AND get a delicious cup of coffee too. And by the way, Crema has one of the best soy latte's I've had in the city... though maybe I should save that for a Crema review...

They had catered my husbands work and before he even proposed he said that we should have Up N Smoke cater our wedding when that time came. SO when we were planning I made sure to hire them. I personally never tried it but I trusted my husbands tastes buds and I couldn't have been happier that we went with them. Rich was so fast to respond and to answer my questions. He was even willing to work with us around the timing of our ceremony and setting up the buffet, so we wouldn't be hearing clinging and clattering while we were saying our vows. Once everyone was served, Rich and his crew put all the left overs in tin pans and had everything cleaned up in a blink of an eye! All night I was hearing about how good the food was from all our guest, and I myself have been loving having the left overs to eat and enjoy for the last few days! I almost want to find another event soon to have to order different food from them so I can try out their whole menu!!!

In the end the hall was decorated even better then I thought. They were so willing to help me and I had a lot of last minute minor changes and they were there helping me set up the room the way I wanted it to be!!!  I also love that the base price includes SO much. Most places that I was going to to have chair decorations it was going to be an extra charge. To do this centerpiece was going to be an extra charge. Villa Tuscana does have a deluxe package but the base package includes so much that if you can't afford the deluxe items you still can have a wide selection of choices! Also there are some great things that come with the package, the DJ is included, the cake is included, and the photographer is included.

I like that she was not overly chatty and she just did what she had to do which was to cut my hair. Leah did not act like she was my bff and I like that. I did not come there to chat but to get a good haircut. 
Leah is skilled and knows how to cut coarse asian hair. She cut my hair just like the way I wanted it and she was so nice. The cut was for $30 which was reasonable and there was no push to sell you any shampoo or hair products which I really like.

Basically I paid $66/night to stay in this hotel. I would not have minded that if the hotel was just honest about it. I think that it was very sneaky for them to practice such a thing.

The resort is huge. It's like an apartment complex and since we arrived late at night the grounds were so dark it was tough to find your duplex like room. It was nice that we were connected only to another room. The grounds were clean and quiet. The bed was soft and comfy. The AC was cold and loud. It had room for 2 people and a kid. The furniture was old and the the tv in the living room and bedroom was ancient. I did not even try and use it. The in room safe actually uses a key..lol (not code).

The room has old stained carpet and the ceilings have beams. The bathroom was old and small. On our first night we actually had no hot water in our room. We showered in lukewarm water. I called the front desk to report it and the lady acted like I was bothering her. The next day at 830 am, thank God we were already awake, with our DND sign on the door we get the maintenance people at our door minimizing our no hot water complain. I insisted they check and surprise, surprise it was broken! I demanded to be moved to another room.

The man on the phone who moved us was probably the only normal person there. He was appropriate  and helpful.  The rest of the staff in this facility have no customer service skills. They just don't care.

They also put a $100 hold on your CC when you check in. I am waiting for them to remove that on my CC or I will definitely dispute it.

I would not recommend anyone to stay here. Except for the soft bed and extra pillows there is nothing here to write home about. There are a lot of other places in Scottsdale that will appreciate your business and you can get more for your money. Stay away!",5,qr9hmaIxq1z9ycgT28PpRw,0.0

We were picked up from the Aria tour bus pickup area, which is underground. Once we picked up a few more people at Excalibur, we were whisked away and headed out of town. A surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures. After this, we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver. Alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test (whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back). All wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality, although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected (no wonder most people gets the red wrong). The first winery we visited was Pahrump Winery. One of the owners, Gretchen, was so very informative and enthusiastic. She was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked. Following a tour and wine tasting, we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch. This lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour. My wife and I, being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines (which I highly recommend). Some of the wines that weren't on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously. We picked out several of our tastings and Gretchen's friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home. We also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to Alan to load onto the bus for us. We were then on the road again and headed to the next winery, I would say that after the first winery, the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience, but I was to be mistaken. The second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and I both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket. As well, the tasting room was a bit ""homey"". I hope they can make it work eventually, but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop. On our way back, Alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink, but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time. I'm not entirely sure that Alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on. I would also encourage Alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing them...if someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery, the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine. Listen enthusiastically and respond positively. Aside from these notes, the tour is great for the value.

The food was OK, but overpriced for what we received. I would not recommend getting anything with snap peas as the chef does not know to trim the stem ends off of the peas. The risotto also seems to be a favorite as it is a side with many entrees; however, it is a bit dense (Gordon Ramsey would not approve). It is very obvious that they are doing their best to make this establishment work, but I think they still need to update themselves a bit in order to draw a younger crowd. At present, it is a ""blue hair"" establishment. This may be the image they are looking to portray and clientele they are looking to attract, but the image discourages those under 40 from dining here.

The bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.  (I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple. 

My friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.

I am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar. It was overall bland, I tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it; they turned out to be peanuts, which I don't love to begin with, but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what you're eating, you know that it's not very flavorful. The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING. I'm really sad there's no decent non-pizza places that deliver to my new apartment.

My boyfriend is a huge buffet fan, and we both love Thai food.  He got really, really excited and I couldn't say no, so we purchased our final deal of the day, went and ran some errands, and finished off at Thai Buffet.

We were the only ones there at that time, but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch (I think we arrived around 4:15-ish).  The buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself, but it is all you can eat.  Joann, the owner, described each of the dishes to us and piled our plates high with a variety of curries, as well as a bowl of soup and another plate of salad.  We couldn't say no to any of the dishes, they all looked super amazing.  And they were.

My favorite was probably the green curry; it wasn't as spicy as some green curries and it had green beans in it, which I love.  Everything tasted more homemade than ""restaurant-y,"" for lack of a better descriptor.  I felt like I was in a Thai grandma's kitchen, and it was awesome.

As we finished our massive plates of food, Joann went back into the kitchen and prepared us bowls of coconut ice cream with mango, pumpkin custard, and sticky rice.  This might have been my favorite part of the meal, but it's hard to say because it was all so good.  I'm a total sucker for sticky rice, though.

Definitely will be back.  You get a great value for the price (even without a Groupon, the buffet is $9.99/person), with quality eats and very friendly service.",1,vbe6VKvvOHn0BkqAhhmEmw,0.4000000059604645

The staff and service was wonderful, and the provided food was more than satisfactory. Wi-Fi was a decent speed (except in the lobby), and was free to members who join their loyalty program.

The main issue I had was with the room I stayed in the first night. It faced another room, and therefore didn't have much natural light. I also couldn't leave the curtains open if I wanted privacy. The worst part was the noise. There was a low pitched humming from air conditioning equipment outside the room. The noise wasn't incredibly loud, but it was very grating and made it difficult to get work done or sleep. 

The next day, I asked for a new room. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and did not make me feel like a nuisance. I got a room that was much quieter, faced the street instead of another room, and had better natural light. I just wish this was true for all the rooms.

Overall, 5 stars for service, 2 stars for the first room, and 4 stars for the second room.",0,WMCgAZsXqrFDLDNYrkdEFA,0.0

My favorite waitress is gone, which I guess is no surprise seeing what the owner Chris did to this place. If I wanted to eat at Grassroots or Twisted Grove then I would drive a few blocks down and eat there. Wally's was something amazing, something special that is so hard to find in a restaurant these days.Now, it's ruined, now is disgusting, now it's a complete waste of your time and hard earned money.

However, the pizza is absolutely amazing. So, we went back a second time, just me and my husband. Our experience was much more delightful.

The breakfast quiche is also average. I think mine had been sitting out for a while, so maybe a fresh one would taste better? Cookies are good, but it is hard to screw up cookies. 

The salads are gigantic. Seriously, who needs a salad that big? I guess if you want it for lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day, what a deal! 

It can be a bit confusing the first time you are there since there are two lines, but you figure out that one is for the bakery, one is for the rest of the food, cafeteria style.

First of all, the ambiance is not that great. Lots of small, loud children. 

The service was very average. We had three servers ask us if we had been helped yet, which I suppose is a good thing, but they all seemed very confused and not sure if we were their table. But good that they asked. Our actual server took quite a while to greet us, and of course he forgot my water. Brought the beer though! 

We started with wings and we wanted to split them...two flavors. At first he told us we couldn't do that, even though it says right on the menu that you can. He made it seem as though he was doing us a favor by splitting them for us! They tasted more like chicken fingers and not wings. Way too much breading. 

I had the California burger, hubby had the fish and chips. The burger was overdone, but I expected it would be so I ordered it medium to get it to medium well. It was well done. Thankfully I didn't order well done! Otherwise it wasn't bad for this kind of place. I also order the potato chips as a side since they make them there. The chips were burnt.  The fish was seriously over breaded (apparently they like doing that here) and way too big. The baked potato and cole slaw...very average.

I had the tagliatelle (sp?) pasta with wild mushrooms. SO good. I'm a big fan of earthy tasty yumminess, and this hit the spot. Why can't I do this at home?? Oh, and the soup... divine! The special was potato and leek soup. Perfectly smooth, must have been strained several times to get it this smooth. Very comforting. Hubby had the mac & cheese for an ap...YUM! That Vermont cheddar is just too good! He had the pork chop for his entree, and I will never be able to make pork chops at home again. Oh well! He thoroughly enjoyed it. For dessert we had the Iron Chef apples, which were perfect. We were pretty full by this point, but these three adorable little tasty apples were just the right finishing touch.

We usually get the same thing every visit, since it is so tasty. We both get the potato cream cheese soup, no matter what time of year (yes, it is that good!), I get the chicken and feta, and hubby gets the BLT. Even at half size, these sandwiches are plenty to fill up on. And, if we feel we can spare the extra calories, we will get a cupcake to go. YUM! I've also had a salad, can't recall which one, but it was fantastic as well. Sometimes we'll also get a loaf of bread to go, and we've varied the kind, all have been great.

Now breakfast...ah, that was just divine. I got the lemon ricotta melt in your mouth pancakes with fruit topping. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! And I got the apple sausage on the side. It was a little dry, but no matter since I was so full on the pancakes. All I needed was a mimosa.... Moving on, hubby got the banana walnut pancakes, which werer also oh so scrumptious.

1) It is not a chain restaurant! It is locally owned by a well trained chef. 

2) The Food. Ok, maybe this should be number one, but with the dominance of chain restaurants in Surprise, I think it is important that it is not a chain. But the food is FANTASTIC. I haven't had a thing I didn't love. My favorite is the Vogue Burger. It's big, but not so enormous that you have no idea how to eat it. The toppings are perfect, not overwhelming, and the meat melts in your mouth. All that yumminess for only $8!! What a deal!  I've also had the sweet potatoe fries (make sure you ask for the dipping sauces), the garden panini, the chicken panini, and the chicken salad (yes, we've been there a few times!) All were fantastic. 

3) The alcohol. No, I am not an alcoholic, but this is worth mentioning! The drinks here are great. I usually get wine, while my hubby will get beer. Both lists are great and reasonably priced (a great white wine for $6/glass). Also, the martinis are fabulous. They shake and pour at your table and they have many specialties. But, what I love most about the martinis is that they are sweet, but not blast of sugar sweet. Often when you order a sweet martini you are blown away from the sweetness factor. Not here! They are just perfect.

4) It has very chic decor. Lots of outdoor seating which isn't great this time of year, but is fabulous when Arizona has nice weather. When does that happen again? Moving on...

5) The manager and owners are awesome. We haven't been there once that they didn't stop by for a chat.

6) It is local! I am a huge supporter of local businesses, which can be extremely challenging in Surprise. 

Ok, now for a couple minor negatives. These are not significant enough to drop the star rating, in my humble opinion. 

1) Sometimes the servers can be a bit lacking. I think this is because the restaurant is still new and still learning. So, we overlook it and instead take the extra time to enjoy good conversation. 

2) It can be crazy busy. I guess that isn't a bad thing necessarily, but we can be spur of the moment and decide to head to Vogue. Luckily we can usually find a seat at the bar and order there. 

So there you go. The best restaurant in Surprise....you will wonder what the heck it is doing in Surprise. It is more Scottsdale-like, but without the snobbiness (no offense to you Scottsdale folk!).",1,dNNhk8urecrV_otn7kiziA,0.30000001192092896

The cheese is cheaper than what you will find at other grocery stores...we did a price comparison. I know when I shop at Sprouts I am not getting overly processed, full of preservatives. I am getting fresh food!! What a concept, huh? And the bulk section is fantastic.

Things didn't start out so good...the manager wanted all of us to pay cash because he didn't want to split the checks! After we explained that none of us had brought cash (seriously, who pays with cash anymore?) he left for a bit, and then came back and said we could split the check. So, I believe they were just being lazy, since they ended up splitting the check anyway. If they had wanted us to pay with cash, they should have informed us when we made the reservations! Poor management. Overall the serves did a good job though after this incident. 

Moving along to the food. The green tea was unlike other green tea that I have had. It had a nutty taste to it that I didn't care for. Perhaps that is more authentic? I don't know, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and didn't drink it. The miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly. Hubby and I shared the gyoza and the spider sushi. The gyoza was crunchy, but not too crunchy, and came in a boat. Nice presentation. The sushi was good too. Nothing out of this world, but good. Another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great. It had scallops, mussels, and shrimp. I didn't try it though, so can't say for sure. And the hot sake was great. Always good to have hot sake with my sushi. And to finish it all off...the green tea ice cream. Now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening! Nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. 

Bottom line: Don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip.",0,dNNhk8urecrV_otn7kiziA,0.10000000149011612

I urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as I got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn't clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt ""oops"" then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut. Next I told her I wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as I'm watching her file my nails I have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval. After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say ""that's not almond"" uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says ""hurry up"" now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies ""oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though"" can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right.

They did call to discuss the color, and even sent photos to help me make a decision (especially since shipping to California was VERY expensive).  I got back to them - via e-mail - that I appreciated their help (which I did) but that I was not going to complete the order and, instead, continue to look for a color closer to what I was after.

They responded by saying to let them know, and how nice the other yarn was.  Two weeks later, I get a message that they've shipped yarn to me!  I immediately contacted them, saying I had canceled the order - that I had told them I was going to keep looking and had not accepted their suggestion, but their response was that it'd been two weeks so they automatically shipped.  I'm guessing they've sent the yarn I initially chose online....I have no idea!  They sent me no warning - no confirmation that they were going to ship....and that's when I discovered they'd charged me for the order the minute it was placed - NOT when it was shipped like every other company I've done business with online.

Let me start off by saying that the store has a very strong, strange odor that has lingered since they first opened (my husband says its tolerable, I find it hard to bear). The layout is nice and the store looks impressive compared to most regular grocery stores (Smiths, Vons, etc). They have a large produce selection at very affordable prices. Lots of exotic fruit, vegetables, and peppers that cannot be found at conventional grocers. However, their herbs and most greens are less than fresh and their selection of organic produce is lacking (and way too expensive when compared to Trader Joes, Whole Foods, or even Vons). They have a great selection of ready made food, but few healthy options. Pizza, ice cream, sushi, pasta salads, pasta entrees, vegetable and starch sides, etc. Some of what I've tried has been good, including salmon stuffed with spinach and pesto, green beans almondine, mixed vegetable rice, broccoli with peppers, etc. They also have a nice looking coffee and tea bar and a good selection of gourmet bread (La Brea Bakery olive bread, jalapeno cheddar, pain rustic, organic whole grain, etc). They have a huge bakery with donuts, pastries, pies and cakes at shockingly low prices, but nothing even remotely health conscious. Salad bar is run of the mill and cant hold a candle to Whole Foods, but again the prices here are incredibly reasonable. They do have an organic/natural food section but they do not have organic eggs, meat, etc. 
I could not do my regular grocery shopping here, but this place is great for specialty items and anyone shopping on a budget. It is far better than a Walmart or Smart and Final and I like the fact that it's family owned. Their produce selection is worth a trip alone. I also find myself coming here when I get home late and don't want to cook- their ready made and pre-packaged food is available 'till they close at midnight.

It is very popular for takeout drinks, in fact I always see 5-0 popping in here for their late night boba fix.  Service is reasonably friendly but definitely on the slow side, especially during busy times.  I would not recommend the food (their squid balls were inedible and smelled like a mixture of hot garbage and the ocean, though perhaps they are an acquired taste!).  I recommend this place based on their atmosphere, tea, and the fact that they are open late.  This is definitely more of a traditional tea house than your average take-out boba shop.",1,dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,0.4000000059604645

There is a face painting station, a dog store, and a booth that sells Scentsy.  There is also an organic, loose leaf tea stand and another with baked goods (although there were very few options).

We ALWAYS paid rent on time, were respectful neighbors to the community and responsible tenants. These apartments were great..... 5 years ago. What happened? If you are debating renting here, let me fill you in on what you are really in for. 

2 years ago the apartments sold to new owners. That was the downfall. Instead of taking care of upgrading appliances, upgrading the landscape for renters or properly managing maintenance requests; they chose to upgrade the front office and future tenant center to increase curb appeal. They chose to close down the main pool.... right before summer. The pool was closed for months. They offered no reimbursement whatsoever. When you sign a lease you are entitled to the amenities that were provided to you when you were shown the apartments. The mailbox lock hardly ever worked and was left open a lot. Car patrolled security (non-armed) that once existed, must have gotten cut because they were no where to be seen in past years by my eye. Apartment building security lights were left burned out even after MANY maintenance requests, which was CLEARLY a security issue. This last December, there was an armed robbery.... AT THE MAILBOX at 10pm! Two men jumped from the nearby bushed area with a gun and robbed a tenant. We no longer felt safe and it was (in my opinion) because of poor management with caring about the safety and well-being of it's tenants that were already moved in.

Once you're in, why do they have to care about your satisfaction and safety? You signed a lease and they know they have you locked in. In the last 2 years, our apartment has been flooded by the upstairs unit 3 times! The first was a faulty bathtub connection but the second time was due to a maintenance repair error (as stated by the maintenance man) and was repaired VERY poorly and took over a week to complete while we couldn't use our main bathroom. The third time (see video and pictures) was also a faulty connection to a washing machine after it had recently been replaced. The managment never apologized once for the inconvenience to flooding our apartment for the third time in two years. They also NEVER came back to fix the damage it left on the walls and pillars, as evident by the water stain on our ceiling and paint that was bubbled. The foundation for the apartment is shifting as well. There were huge cracks in our walls from who knows what. Our sliding door on our patio would no longer shut correctly because the door frame was warped from the building's unrepaired structure (multiple times we put in requests to see what was going on with this. Nothing was fixed, just noted on our maintenance record) 

Sounds great, right? There's more. So you can see how unprofessional they are, but how about unethical? They started bribing tenants to put in ""5 star"" reviews on yelp to get entered into raffles for iPods and other prizes. They also, recently, started asking new tenants to put in ""5 star"" reviews to get some fees taken off their move in costs. If you ran a sound business with great satisfaction, you wouldn't need to bribe people into giving you 5 star reviews, would you? Shame on any business that does this. And last, but not least, we are (at the time of writing this review 4/15/16) still waiting for our security deposit. Like I said, we ALWAYS paid rent on time, for 6 years! And the one time we are LEGALLY due our deposit IN FULL within 30 DAYS of moving out (Nevada States Law NRS 118A.242), it has not arrived. We have called Jessi, the manager, multiple times and never received a call back from her. We received one email stating the refund has been ""processed"" but still no update on the status or postage date.They tell us they are short staffed and sound really sad on the phone but guess what? You are a business! Act like it. Don't make excuses, just fix issues. If I were to tell them 2 years ago that I had some personal problems and couldn't pay rent (which never happened, just example given) would they let me pay late or maybe within 7-10 business days? NO! They would have fined me and eventually evicted us if they didn't receive payment. These are not even all the issues we experienced but this about sums up our time there. It is not right that businesses don't care about the tenants after they have signed a lease because they know they have them locked. We should have moved out 2 years ago, that was our fault for staying so long. But we have now moved into a new apartment with better appliances and staff, 24hr armed security car patrol, maintenance requests that were taken care of within the same day... all for the same price we paid there! Do yourself a favor and look around and judge for yourself. I can tell you that we feel like Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption when he finally swims through the sewage drain and is free. Good Riddance, Vintage at the Lakes. And no, you can't buy a 5 star review from me.",50,nS4mcwbdFynSchOqtDhWsA,-0.20000000298023224

In a society full of high-speed entertainment (internet, cell phones and video games) fueled by a ""I want it yesterday"" mentality, it is refreshing to see something like Toys 4 Smiles. These toys are very simple, yet very high quality. It is rare in this day and age that a child will receive a toy that not only was HANDMADE for them but also requires them to use their imaginations. The way I think of it is that maybe some of these kids getting theses toys don't have a lot of people in their lives that make them seem ""worth it."" Well, I am hoping that some of these kids will get these toys and understand that a stranger took the time to make them by hand and that a stranger CARES. They are worthy of it and deserve it.

- Friendly staff! Always smiling and it's a relief to see people working in F&B in Las Vegas that look like they are genuinely happy.
- The food. I'm sorry to say but I didn't expect great food. I was mistaken. Everything we tried was pretty dang good. The breakfast burrito was great. The club sandwich was huge and great tasting. The quesadilla was maybe my favorite I've ever had, with the peppers inside, the crema on top and it wasn't greasy at all. Corn beef hash was also good. The eggs and bacon may be the downfall for them. They seem like they are instant and the bacon was majorly overcooked. Looking forward to trying the chicken pot pie and some other things there!

The downside I think for this place is the..... NAME. It's hard to associate ""custom built"" with pizza, especially if you are driving down the street and can't see the ""pizza"" part written very small. To me, this seems like a great name for a cabinet maker or something.

I too toured the facility and I like Marc T was in awe of the facility and the cleanliness everything was so new and properly stored, I felt like if I had to put my baby somewhere this is what I would want.  I did in fact enroll my child for the summer program the rates are high but I figured someone has to pay for the amazing aquarium that was mentioned in the previous review and it included snacks and 'breakfast & lunch' so I dove in!! 

With MUCH push my husband finally agreed to let me pay the fees which included a enrollment fee of 150 plus the first week, (you are charged weekly on Fridays) I chose to put my child on an easy-pay system where they would pull out weekly for his tuition Mistake 1. The first week they charged us our normal tuition plus enrollment fee (183 for 3 days mon, wed, fri & 150 enrollment) then no less than 3 days later they charged us again! This being our first week my husband and I were a little taken aback but we figured eh maybe a fluke,  after addressing the issue with  Kaylee we were told ""no worries, well note your account and we just wont charge you for next week"" great I thought lets move forward then 3 days later ANOTHER charge now I was getting a little annoyed.

I don't know your financial situation but the tuition is high so these accidental charges were starting to hurt after the 3rd accidental charge. Again I went to the office and spoke with Angela the finance director and I told her we were a little concerned we had only been attending one week and already had been charged for 3 weeks plus enrollment. I kindly asked for a refund as I didn't mind waiting for the first accidental charge to catch up, I was more than a little peeved about the other charges. I talked to Selena and she told me that I needed to bring in my credit card statement that showed the charges...Lol I wasn't lying. Don't they keep records of what they are charging peoples cards!!
Angela tells me SUUUUURE you can have a refund in 6-8 weeks!!!! 6-8 weeks because your finance department cant keep its records straight? I snatched up my easy pay document so fast she had a paper cut!!! 

So I let it go AGAIN (really didn't have a choice we were 3 weeks in on charges) I continued to bring my son. When I would pick up my son the room was so hot I could smell the children's sweat but this is AZ heat so I figured man the AC must be working hard to keep this place cool and I would bring him at 8 so maybe they had just turned it on. 
One of my biggest concerns was the child to teacher ratio, were talking 15 KIDS TO EVERY ONE TEACHER!!!! Why? because that's the minimum that the state will allow wouldn't you want your child to go to place that goes above a beyond the bare minimum? It was a ZOO when I would have to get him early. There was no less than 35 kids in the class at any given time. Great! I thought a great way for him to socialize with children his age. They called me less then 1 hour into his class saying that my son had attacked a little boy, when I went to get him thinking my son had mauled a little boy I was very upset he had never hit before, when I walked in he was sitting alone (I assume time out) which I am okay with but when I asked if the little boy was okay I looked he had a scratch the size of a sewing needle, not downplaying what my son did he should never hit but they are 5!!! They are learning they are going to get into scuffs.  My son came home on the 3rd day with a large scratch on his forehead I didn't say anything because I get it, they have scuffs and boys can be a little rough. After the 2nd time I chose to remove him from the program, just in time in my opinion I just got a letter saying they needed another 150  for supplies. Lol
Across the hall from my sons class was the infant room, my heart would break to see the infants crying with no one trying to console them. As a mother I know that some have no choice but to put their child in daycare and work but would you want your baby to be screaming because they aren't required to have more teachers in the class?. It just made me so sad to see this daily.   

The staff is SUPER UNFRIENDLY I actually stopped smiling to them because you know that feeling when you smile at someone and they look a you like you have gone mad smiling at them!!

In conclusion if you feel the need to enroll you must be okay with the following:

1. Your child must NEVER make a mistake like get a little rough with another kid, if you work plan to miss a few days because you will be asked to come and get him

2. Have an endless supply of money because they will need it. 150 enrollment, 150 for 'supplies' ( must be for the starbucks) plus tuition 
3. must be okay with unfriendly staff drop your kid and leave. 
4.Must be able to figure out their plans they don't tell you crap till day of!

The server said, ""medium, we prepare all of our fish medium."" Uncooked shrimp? No thanks.  We ordered two appetizers, a salad, steaks, and a side dish.  The oysters were placed on the table without explanation of the accompanying sauces.  The salad was good, tomatoes were fresh.  The lobster mashed potatoes had so much butter that it was pooling around the edges of the bowl.  One steak was overcooked, came out medium well instead of medium rare.  The server took it back and the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered to even cook both steaks again so we could eat together.  We felt it was handled appropriately and would easily have returned for future meals after this.  However, the steak never came out.  I asked the server after a long while to see if it may be ready.  She came back from the kitchen frazzled and said, ""it will be out but I don't have a time to give you.""  Then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat, set it down, did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left. It was very fatty and appeared to be NOT the cut of meat (filet) that I had ordered.  It was over cooked, again.  The server happened to walk over and said, ""yes, I thought that it didn't look right.""  I left without eating dinner.  She brought the check over and said, ""I'm sure you guys don't want dessert, so I brought the check.""  The manager never followed up to see if I had received the new steak.  The issues could've easily been solved had someone not dropped the ball and given up on following through.  They did credit the check for two steaks, but really that was not the issue.

It's such a great place though that's probably why it's so busy!",0,IKChsSm17dLG0mTHjFiDLg,0.6000000238418579

Love the beer that they have here. Lots of Great Dane brews and more common craft brews. Food is pretty good with burgers, brats, pulled pork, chicken, fries, slaw, potato salad all available.

Would recommend paying the $5 for the reserved seating in advance though the only drawback is that this is not like a picnic table so it is a bit hard to have a group there in reserved seats and all be comingling unless you are getting up a lot.

We played in late December so there was a frost delay but once we got off it was sunny and not very cold. The group in front of us was playing a bit slow from the outset and by the third hole the ranger was on them to speed up (which they did).

Course is playable for many skill levels. My group played the tips and are above average golfers and we enjoyed our experience a lot. It was not an overly challenging course but still required skill. Very professionally run course with 3 separate nines (we played Ironhead and Acacia). 

Course was in good shape and greens rolled true.

The rooms have kitchens which provide what you need if you want to make your own food while you are there.

The concierge is definitely helpful as they recommended a good breakfast place (though there are others) and helped us get a tee time at a discounted rate at a nice course nearby.

Assuming you have a car, going to Sedona is a must and is a pretty drive up there. Also interesting if you are adventurous and are comfortable driving on unpaved roads in the mountains is driving the Apache Trail which goes out to Tonto National Forest and Roosevelt Lake.

I was totally prepared to turn the iPhone in and get the 80$ credit so I wouldn't have to deal with fixing it. Keith explained ALL of my options and I had a clear understanding of what I was getting. I switched from Verizon, WAS VERY IMPORTANT I KEEP MY NUMBER.. he transferred my  contacts(offered to transfer photos if needed), had the screen protector put on my phone. The best part is he did all of this in 20 MINUTES. 

Everyone at this store was extremely professional and friendly. Keith understood what I needed and I felt comfortable about making the switch from Verizon after 14 years!!! Nicholas and Robbi (sp?) were knowledgeable and professional as well.

My last passport photo was taken at a Black's, and was so bad that customs agents actually laughed every time they saw it.

In comparison, I actually look so much better in this photo than I do in real life! John (the owner) absolutely adores what he does. From the second I walked in, he had nothing but compliments for me. He gives you the option to choose from multiple poses, and then takes the best one and does some slight Photoshop magic to make it even better. He then prints it while you wait.

Cash only - all in, it cost $7.90 for 2 passport photos with the official stamp, and he threw in an additional one ""for my mom"". 

Overall, it took 10 minutes for the whole ""experience"", but it also never felt rushed. I'm tempted to go back to get other random photos taken, just because he made me feel so good about myself!

At first they were very accommodating, they let us see the room and discuss how we were going to set it up for our party and went over the menu's with us. It came as a big surprise to me when we showed up and had to wait over an hour and a half for our first course to come out! Everything just went downhill from there. We complained to our server multiple times (we had 1 server for a party of 40) that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it. I had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside, fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner. Then when half of our guests left I realized they never sent out dessert and we had to ask for it! I was then told we should have requested dessert to come out, what kind of restaurant waits 45 minutes to bring dessert after a meal is finished?

My BIGGEST disappointment was how the catering manager, Michelle, handled everything after I sent her an email.

It was my first trip to Las Vegas and my boyfriend wanted to impress. By taking me here, he definitely did as well as enjoyed the food himself.

We were recommended to try the Chef's menu and also followed it with the wine pairings. We both enjoyed the Ahi tuna tartar, LOVED the lobster pot pie, which got the pie to innards content right (I like a little breadness with each bite), and both of us were in awe of the Kobe with sear foie on top. I don't know if they still do that, but both of us just melted a little inside with each bit. It's in our top 2 of steaks...and trust me, we eat a lot of steak. I don't even remember the dessert, that's how mind blowing the steak was. I'm sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at Michael Mina was nothing but excellent.

Service was impeccable, and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread. The wine pairings were done well, but I was happy I was staying in the Bellagio after dinner because that was a significant amount of alcohol in one sitting. The atmosphere was elegant without pretension or ""over-styling."" Probably the most comfortable restaurant I went to in Vegas. Most people were well dressed (i.e. slacks and dresses) but no need for anything over the top. I wore a little black dress and my boyfriend wore a nice sports coat with dark slacks. While we were probably the youngest ones there, the servers didn't treat us like we didn't belong there, which sometimes happens in upscale restaurants. Big plus for that.

I'd love to go back, but this time, I'd probably order something different just so I could try other things...but I'd get the Kobe again. For sure.

It's worth the pennies to go, and try the chef's menu!",0,1cd1TjQEynOjhBT-3Qnsjg,0.5

My boyfriend is a carnivore and steak-addict, to the point where his friends recommended he come here.

We started with the Beef Tasting Menu, and while the crudo was well done, my issue was so many places seem to do a raw Kobe appetizer. Something a little more creative (with same meat!) would have been lovely. I will say I really loved the beef-cheek ravioli - I stole my boyfriends because I felt my portion needed to have more in it. Personally, the wet and dry aged beef were good and ""beefy and meaty,"" but my preferences run towards melty and buttery type of steak. I preferred the dry aged to the wet...the wet aged just seemed a little bland in comparison. 

We veered off course a bit - my boyfriend wanted MORE meat and we ordered the dry-aged bone in Rib-Eye for 2. I didn't eat much as my boyfriend devoured it, but the meat was flavorful for sure...just not my style. Ending with the tasting menu desert, which I can't remember because it was so generic. I think creativity could have been a lot better.

Service was good and they helped us find wines to pair with our dinner well. Our server was so excited we wanted more steak - but maybe he just wanted the bigger tip resulting from the massive bill? The worst part of the meal was being seated in an area that looked out onto the casino/hotel walkway. I prefer people not staring at me or my meals when I eat. 

Lastly, the price. While the cuts of meat were good, I just don't feel the costs justified what was done in the meal. The creativity was lacking and maybe it's because it's such a meat-BASED restaurant...but I feel like it could have been more creative. 

If you liked dry-aged steak and big, bold Italian reds, this is the place for your. But I prefer my steak to melt like butter in my mouth and this isn't the place for it. I will tell you my boyfriend enjoyed it far more than I did. Otherwise, maybe try another, more diverse restaurant in the Palazzo/Venetian Restaurant row.",4,1cd1TjQEynOjhBT-3Qnsjg,0.20000000298023224

I made reservations at CUT back in May while visiting LV, but due to an unfortunate bout of illness (DO NOT EAT DUCK FRIED RICE FROM THE BELLAGIO POKER ROOM)  that required hospitalization, I was forced to give my reservations to my friends. The next day, visiting me in the hospital, they raved about the quality of the steaks, being from overseas. I knew that next time I was in Las Vegas, I would need to go.

What luck that several weeks later my boyfriend did extremely well in a WSOP event, and we returned to Las Vegas and made another reservation at CUT for mid June.

We were seated a booth with a leather tables and service was quick and prompt. We knew we wanted steak, but my boyfriend and I have very different tastes in wine, so the sommelier came over to help us with the (very) awkward iPad wine list. She helped us pick just the right wine that met our desires. 

After ordering our wine, we got down to business. For appetizers, we had the Kobe sashimi and the Roasted Beets with goat cheese. They actually balanced quite nicely, as we knew we had a lot of meat ahead of us. 

For our main courses, I chose the American Wagyu filet, normally 6 oz, and added an extra 2 oz for extra. I love Kobe filet for it's melting butter like quality, and this cut was no exception. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and it was the quality and taste I would expect for a $130 steak. My boyfriend chose the New York Sirloin tasting that consisted of the dry aged American sirloin, American Wagyu, and NZ Wagyu. He ordered it rare and it came slightly over rare (which is acceptable, because these cuts were THICK) and they were epic. Just meaty and buttery at the same time. My steak-loving boyfriend was in heaven. 

For sides, we had the mac & cheese, and spring peas with bacon. To be honest, we didn't eat much of those as we focused primarily on the steak, but both were good - also rich and bacony! 

After some excessive meat consumption, I saw a souffle float by to another table. I had to dig deep down, but I never regretted the chocolate souffle. It was rich but airy at the same time. I didn't even look at the other desserts, but it was one of the best I've had. The small little cookies and tarts were a nice little treat we had wrapped up to-go that went nicely with our coffee for breakfast the next morning.

The service was extremely attentive and water refills/bread requests came quickly and discretely. (Yes, the bread was that good too). My one disappointment is the overall atmosphere. The overly slick design and mirrors everywhere made me feel like I was in an HGTV show instead of a restaurant.  When I think steakhouse, I think a little more comfortable and a little less ""sleek."" That said, I also deplored the amount of  people taking pictures...man people, don't use flash in a restaurant, I like to eat my food without blinding. If you're so consumed by where you are, please avoid me at all costs.

We ordered two drinks which was the Classic Taiwanese Milk Tea and the Signature Thai Tea. Milk tea was alright, it wasn't as sweet nor milky as most boba places. Thai tea was just like your regular Thai tea that you get at restaurants. And the boba was unusually smaller than your regular boba which was surprising coming from a boba place.

What was really disappointing was the amount of ice that was in the drink! My boyfriend and I took two sips of the milk tea to try the flavor and noticed that the cup was pretty much ice! The 12oz cup (not even the bottle) was filled with 2/3 ice & 1/3 tea. I know it's being nit picky but I feel like I got gypped paying $4.50. Mind you, they were out of their cool bottles which comes standard with their drinks and still payed for the same price for a plain regular plastic cup - no name or anything.

We walked through the Excalibur and, boy, does that place need to be brought out of the Middle Ages. As for the Trop, I'd like to put in a good word for the buffet at Cafe Nikki. It was simple and almost elegant and not what we expected from a buffet on the Strip. The cafe has a beach theme, which keeps things light and modern. Everything we tried tasted good, or good enough, and the desserts were crazy good.

Like the movies the musical is packed full of campy humor and gore which is exactly why you love the movies. The song's lyrics are at most times over powered by the music, but I would have to say my favorite one was ""WTF.""

This reminded me of Community Theater with a few surprisingly good singers, terrible props and uncomfortable seats. I found it really funny that you could all ready see the tears and faded blood stains from past performances on their clothes from the very start. 

My group did the splatter zone and we LOVED it. They get you from all sides, but mostly it came from the back right. With the spaltter zone you get VIP seating, 2 for 1 bar drinks and a white Evil Dead t-shirt.

The odd thing about the ""blood"" was it was warm. I never did get use to that.

If you've seen all 3 movies, you will have fun. However, it does take a moment to get into. 

Here are a few things to think about:
-Don't go if you think this is going to be scary. It's not.
-Don't go if you are offended by swearing. They do it A LOT.
-Don't go if you hate campy movies with cult followings.
-Don't go if you never seen any of the Evil Dead movies.
-Don't go if you hate musicals.
-Don't go if you don't want to get ""pinkish water"" coloring on your clothes. It can get on you EVEN IF you aren't in the spatter zone. Mainly the first and second row behind the VIP area.
-Don't go because someone talked you into it. You won't like it. We saw a few couples/groups not come back after the second act because someone was whining they wanted to go.

DO GO-
-If you love the Evil Dead movies.
-If you have an open mind.
-If you are willing to ""gamble"" $40-$70 dollars on something you may not like.
-If you quoting the popular movie lines with the actors. The crowd was shouting these lines. It was a great vibe.

Classic barber chairs at big mirrors in gold painted wooden frames sitting on what look like antique-shop dressers (but they all match so probably not) plus photos of James Dean, The Rat Pack, and Laurel & Hardy (!) and classic rock on the radio. Nice enough surroundings.

Had trouble communicating with my barber, whose English was limited. Simple questions were met with blank looks. We managed, but not without difficulty. The haircut was fine, not that I needed anything out of the ordinary. Oddly, the shampoo followed the cut, so he was working with somewhat dirty hair.

The hot towel shave was a real disappointment. First, the chairs do not recline at all, so there is no sense of relaxation. You either sit up straight and strain your neck to bend your head back, or slide forward in the chair and strain your back. The hot towel is perfunctory.

What changed was the portion of food. Most places increase prices when they need to. Not this place. No, what they did here is a disgusting disservice to the customer. They instead lessened the portion of the food by more than twice it was. It's less than the kids portion compared to some places. Yes! So now if you want the similar portion that you had before, then you have to pay for it twice. I think it would still be less than what one portion was though. Which makes this restaurant now grossly overpriced. 

For example, the last time I went here I had a combo plate that was the beef and chicken teriyaki with spam. I asked for no beef and replace with more spam. This is what I usually used to get. So you know what they gave me? 2 tiny pieces of spam! The chicken portion was also minuscule. And a tiny scoop of rice too, not even a whole scoop. 

I eat at many places in Vegas and around the country as I travel all the time. I mostly use yelp to give great reviews for amazing places that need more attention from customers. This place though, I logged in for the first time in a long time to give this one star review. It is that bad compared to what they used to be. It is way more expensive than every Manhattan non-waiter place I have been to, along with Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Miami, Toronto, etc. 

Guys, if this portion issue has changed please let me know. I will then try it again and see for myself and update my review accordingly. I used to love this place, but now it just still gets me mad when I think about what I paid for and then got.

UPDATE: May 2017

I was traveling with another one of my friend's and her husband and we got to the hotel around 2 p.m.  We waited in line to check in and asked if we could check in early.  We were told that the room that they held for us were given to people that stayed longer and that our rooms were not guaranteed, even though we booked them about a year in advance.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  We told her we were part of a wedding party that had blocked a bunch of rooms, but they still didn't care.  When they said they had 2 rooms available, the rooms were in 2 separate buildings away from where the bride had wanted us to stay.  We told the lady where we wanted to stay and she said come back in a hour and they should be ready.

We came back exactly an hour later, only to be told they weren't ready yet.  The lady had us sit and wait 20 more minutes while she waited on a call back to make sure the rooms were clean.  They also had one room with a King bed and one room with 2 doubles, even though my friend and I had both booked rooms with King beds.  I let her have the King room, but once again, what's the point of reserving a room, if you aren't going to get what you asked for.

My room was okay.  I didn't have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe.  I did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running.  That was really loud.  Also, even though there are shades to keep the light out, it was still bright once the sun started to rise and that made me wake up way earlier than I wanted to.

After the first day, my room was not cleaned by 3:00 p.m.  When I was getting ready to meet my friends, the cleaning lady came back around 3:30 p.m. and I told her I will be leaving soon and to come back.  On the day I was leaving, she knocked on my door at 9:00 a.m. to see when she could clean my room and I told her I was leaving today.  Shouldn't she know that?

The food at the Mexican restaurant and Marilyn's Cafe was just so-so.  We only ate there b/c there was noting else, but it wasn't that great.  I would have gone somewhere else, if there was something else close by.

The bar in the lobby would have been okay if it wasn't for the jazz music.  I'm not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it.  Also, the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous!!!  My friend and I ordered Shirley Temple's, which consist of Sprite and cherry flavor and they cost $4 each!!!!!!!!  What the heck!?  Also, a small bottle of water, about half the size of a regular bottle, was $4!!!  That is so ridiculous!

The pool was probably the only thing that wasn't that bad.  We were able to get lounge chairs both times we went to the pool.  I know people I was with were annoyed with the one waitress that was going around getting drink and food orders.  She was taking forever on some things and even gave food to the wrong people.  

On my last day, I had checked out and wanted to spend a few hours at the pool.  I went into the bathroom to change and I came out and put my stuff on the counter.  The cleaning lady was in there staring at me with an annoyed look, so I asked her if I was in her way.  She rudely said yes and I asked her if I should move to one side or something and she huffed out saying, something about coming back.  So uncalled for!!

When it was time to leave, we asked the bellman to get us a cab and he waited about 10-15 mins until he called for one, which of course made us late to get to the airport.

I definitely won't be staying at this hotel again.  I appreciate that my friend picked a  place to help all the wedding guests save money, but it was an awful experience.",1,WQbJUmnkVpbbOaWMQloHDg,-0.20000000298023224

Given Narcisse was the least expensive of the Happening Gourmand restaurants I was pleasantly satisfied with the meal.   

In fact out of the 3 HG restaurants we tried Narcisse was my favorite.  

The standouts for me were -

The escargots  - nice twist on traditional escargots with cheese melted.
The beef bavette - inexpensive but well prepared piece of meat.
The french fries - savory and lots of them.

I had been seeing another dermatologist and esthetician in ahwatukee, but needed to search for a more natural and friendly office. I love how cozy the space is when you walk in and how family-oriented the workers are. 

My first visit was just a quick exam with suggestions of switching out chemical-filled products. I was even gifted a sample for my inflamed cystic acne. The Green Tea Gel Cleanser, I believe. I like it for when I don't wear make up and just need a quick clean at the end of the night. 

On my second visit, I had the pleasure of getting a personalized facial from Diana, who I adore! She's super informative and really taught me a lot about how my diet would affect my break outs. I kid you not, after cutting down on gluten (was hard since I work at a brewery) and dairy like Diana recommended, my skin smoothed out almost instantly. Anyways, after my rejuvenating, relaxing, and gentle facial, I was gifted another sample. The Clove Gel! Immediately after using this gel, my redness calmed down, my oils weren't as crazy, and I definitely saw improvements on my face. It makes my face feel super smooth and cool. 

I just went in for my third visit, only to purchase that Clove Gel she gave me a sample of. I can't wait to see Diana again so I can ask her about what products I should use next since my acne is almost gone and I only have scars and hyper-pigmentation. 

I truly appreciate how friendly the team is and how helpful they are with the products they carry. They have a line exclusive to them I think, and it's mostly natural/organic, which I love!

I can find the best meats here! I only come here for my Korean BBQ meats, stew meats, and anything else I need for soups or broths. It's always looking fresh and for items that are about to go bad, instead of throwing it out, they put them out at a discounted price.

At 18, I took myself to one of those chain dental offices and paid over $1500 for two root canals. I was never given an explanation as to what a root canal was or that I'd need to pay for crowns separately. So, I got the roots taken care of but due to insufficient funds (because I'm 18!) I couldn't afford crowns to keep them secure. 

From 19-21, I hopped from local dentists to dental schools, and even Mexico to save money on the treatments (crowns, bone grafts). I couldn't pull through with most places because they were discomforting and too business-like. 

Finally I found this place on yelp and after the consultation with Dr. Walker, I knew I could trust his work. He thoroughly went over my teeth, proposed a treatment plan, and even broke it down into separate operations to help lessen the financial stress. Most dental places feel fancy and the work they suggest never seems necessary (like they just want my money), but here, I understood the importance of each extraction and surgery because Dr. Walker took the time to explain things. 

In the past few months we extracted a tooth, did a bone graft, and a root canal retreatment. All were extremely terrifying at first, but I trusted him. Everything went smoothly and even when the retreatment got complicated Dr. Walker comforted me by staying positive and updating me throughout the procedure. (The scariest thing is hearing someone say ""oh no"" without a follow-up) To be honest, I was trying to stay awake so I could keep my mouth open; it was that easy-going in the room. 

I genuinely appreciate the work he's done and can't say enough about how great my endo experience was.

The area the goats were weeding for us was overgrown with poison ivy, making it impossible for us to get in and weed ourselves.  The goats absolutely tore through the poison ivy.

Because it was a big area that was very overgrown, it took a 2-3 days, but the goats absolutely cleared everything out.  

The goats can't clear everything out like weed killer, but the most they left were a few small weeds sticking a few inches out of the ground.  We were very surprised how well it worked.  

Also, the area where the goats were focused was along the bank of a lake and we weren't sure how the goats would do, because a lot of the poison ivy was very close to the water.  But, the goats took care of everything.

There were like 3 servers hanging around not busy while our food just sat there. And our server was hanging out at a table sitting with them for like 10 minutes when our food was just sitting there. Finally we got up and asked where our food was and it still took another 5 or so minutes for someone to bring it. The tacos were soggy by this time and not good.

The key to staying at this hotel is have your paperwork in order if you don't they will double charge you....that's just the way it is. I booked this hotel through priceline made sure not to give my credit card to the hotel.

Do not give these people your credit card. 

I wanted an early check-in but they wanted to charge me an additional $14.95 resort fee for checking in before 11am. The resort fee is an additional $14.95 per night. I waited until 11am to check in.

The resort fee is for internet service in your room supposedly...I believe it's just a way for the hotel to make more money.

When I did check in the woman at the front desk tried to charge me for 5 night resort fee when I only paid for 4 nights through price line. I had to correct her by showing her my price line paperwork.

I used cash for $100 refundable incidental deposit and the 3 night resort fee which was slightly under $60.

They tried to put me in a handicapped room (don't know why) but I requested a regular room instead.

During check in if you don't correct these people early they will double charge you or give you a terrible room. I still ended up with a really bad room.

The room I had was in the basement the window view was an outside wall. The bathtub was clogged with hair an green slimy stuff. I tried to pour bleach in it to unclog it but that did not work. The bathroom sink had hair in it. The carpet looked old dingy and dirty.

The entire room reeked of cigarette smoke.

The buffet was bad.....for some reason it looked like the food had been sitting out all day without being stirred or freshened up or replace and it was not cheap.  Dinner cost $12. 

I didn't complain to management about my experience at the hotel I didn't think they would do anything about it......according to the other reviews I read.

It's a cheap ran down smelly hotel.....at least I wasn't double charged. It's not the maid fault that the rooms are ran down.",1,vkHzMbYUWQRnHbC9vKGjQg,-0.5

I walked in one day on the spur of the moment with my fiancé, and made an appointment for later in the week (when he wouldn't be there).  When I arrived with my mom that morning, I was greeted promptly by the friendly girl at the desk.  She got basic info from me on what I was looking for/budget/etc.  We then were led to the fitting area with my consultant, Tatiana.  After reviewing what I was looking for, she started to pull a few dresses at a time for me to try on.  She took the time to ask me what I liked and didn't like from each of my dresses.  She was really sweet, professional, and genuine.  I told myself I wasn't going to buy a dress at my first appointment ever...but after 3 hours of trying on dresses, and trying my favorites back on a second time...I selected the gown of my dreams!  Not only was I never rushed, or ever made to feel like I was just a sale, my consultant Tatiana made me feel like an instant friend for the day.  She didn't try to blow through my budget and bring me dresses that were on the high end of my budget - she really did try her best to make me feel amazing and beautiful.  I ended up picking a dress that wasn't even what I had in mind - and I'm so glad for it!  The manager was also very polite and my mom and I were happy she took the time to introduce herself to us.  Yes the store had other brides, and yes there were others looking in the mirrors, and yes my consultant had to split her time...but it's such an exciting moment - I didn't realize how much time was passing, and it took some pressure off to not have her there standing by me the whole time, allowing me to talk to my mom about each dress.  As someone who also works in guest service, I can tell you Tatiana was great at multi-tasking - she gave me all the time I needed, and when she was working with me, she had her focus completely on me.  When I came back to the store a few weeks later to pick up my ordered sash, I had another great experience!  The lady at the desk this time also greeted me, and helped me find the headpieces (since I now wanted to try them on too)!  A consultant who was in the area was really kind, and he asked me if I needed help, and offered suggestions for what I was looking for.  When I finally made my way to the counter an pick up what I was actually there to get (my order), the manager and consultant there were both great...I am honestly blown away with it all, because I know it's rare to find that level of incredible service from a large chain.  Thank you, Tatiana, and the whole crew at this David's Bridal location!

After we had the bacon board, my husband and I took our server's suggestion and ordered their short ribs, which our server said were phenomenal. The short ribs come with fried coleslaw and we asked the server if we could sub asparagus and not get the fried coleslaw. So, the short ribs and asparagus come out. The short ribs were tough, small, and didn't have much flavor.

Then, when our bill came we were charged the full amount of the short ribs and coleslaw, and an additional $4 for our asparagus, which clearly shows that it's $4 on it's own. So, why did we have to pay full price to sub them and then not get a side that was supposed to come with our meal? So, we basically paid full price to not receive a side, and paid an extra four dollars for asparagus that would have been $4 regardless if it was subbed or not. 

We also experienced some issues splitting our bill and my husband and I were charged $30 more than we were supposed to be, even after telling our server that some of the items on our receipt weren't ours before she swiped our card. We were still overcharged and had to cancel one tab, but still be recharged for the other.

This place started out a wonderful experience but it seemed to get worse and worse as the night when on.

We went to Power and they asked for our contract. We gave them all our paperwork Big 2 had given us and came to find out they never gave us a copy of the contract. They also told us our payments were so high because almost $8,000 of stuff was added on to our contract that we didn't need.

From the planning of the ceremony to the initial consultation at the venue to the actual ceremony to the photo viewing appointment after the ceremony...we were very, very happy with everything!!  Yvette Prather was our wedding coordinator and the first person we had contacted about booking our wedding there. She was very helpful with getting all of my questions answered and addressing all of the concerns that I had. Our package included a luxury sedan picking us up from our hotel and taking us to get our marriage license and then to the initial consultation at the venue. The driver of the luxury sedan was awesome and super sweet...she even gave us a card to congratulate us on the wedding. Very thoughtful!! Once we got to the venue to see it for the first time and have the consultation, we worked with Danielle. She was amazing!! She was very friendly and answered all of the questions that we had. We were also very happy with the Terrace!! I could see where it would be a little small for people who have a lot of guests. For our wedding, it was just my husband and I and the venue could not be more perfect. We had another luxury sedan driver that dropped us off for brunch after the consultation, and he was awesome too!! Our package also included a limo driver to take us to and from the ceremony, and that limo driver was amazing and very nice and friendly as well. A few minutes after we arrived for our ceremony, they brought us upstairs to wait in the bridal suite. We probably stayed in there for 30 minutes or so before our ceremony started. It was so nice that we got to stay in there before the ceremony because they do have other weddings going on at the same time and it made us feel special and like it was just our day. While we were waiting in the bridal suite, we met Reverend Garcia, who was very nice and sweet and just all around awesome. We also had several pictures taken in the bridal suite, and our photographer was amazing and did a wonderful job. Our ceremony went off without a hitch. We chose 2 songs to play when I walked down the aisle and then when we walked out and that made it very sentimental and special. We were also each able to recite our own vows, which made it even more personal. I had chosen to have the rose petals sprinkled down the aisle as well and was very happy with that decision as it turned out looking great. All in all, the venue was spectacular!! We had a 9:30 PM ceremony and it just turned out so lovely at that time because the gazebo is lit up and looks beautiful. We were very, very pleased with the venue!! We had some friends and family members who watched the online live streaming of our ceremony back home, and they said that it turned out great and they felt like they were able to join in on our special day. After the ceremony, we had more pictures taken (which pretty much all turned out awesome by the way), and then we checked out by giving them the address to mail our marriage certificate to. After the ceremony, our limo driver dropped us off at Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere, and he was just as kind as could be. We had our photo viewing appointment back at Vegas Weddings the morning after our ceremony. At that appointment (less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended), we were able to view a wedding slideshow of pictures that they had edited. We absolutely fell in love with the majority of the pictures that they had taken and ended up just purchasing our entire photo package at that time. The entire package is kind of pricy, but it is only a fraction of what we would have paid a photographer back home if we had had a ""traditional"" ceremony. They were able to give us a CD copy of our wedding slideshow, a DVD copy of our wedding video, and a CD copy of all of our wedding pictures in color, sepia, black and white, and thumbnail versions in hand at the end of that appointment...which means that we received all of that less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended. And the pictures were high quality and turned out so beautiful!! I was floored!! Especially when I hear of so many people complaining that they have not received their wedding photos a month or more after their wedding. I was very blown away that they had everything done and ready to go that quickly!! It was awesome!! And the quality of our wedding video was amazing too...it turned out so well!! Everyone that we worked with through Vegas Weddings was very friendly, helpful, and dedicated to making our wedding experience there as special for us as possible. We would recommend for anyone considering getting married in Vegas to get married at Vegas Weddings!!!! I will even be telling people who are engaged and not sure of what they want their wedding to be like yet to go to Vegas just to get married at Vegas Weddings!!

We split the tofu tod for an appetizer. Panko coated and fried tofu with a crazy good sweet/spice dipping sauce. The tofu was well seasoned (its easy for fried things to go bland and this didn't) and had great texture. 

I had chicken pad thai. For $13 it was a generous portion. It came out piping hot and with a perfect level of spice (I requested on the mild side of medium, which isn't easy to nail).

I also tried my husband's massaman curry with chicken, sweet potato, and peanut. It was phenomenal, really rich from coconut milk with great flavor and heat. 

The service here wasn't bad, but they're definitely still learning. Our waitress mentioned that her brother opened the restaurant with his wife, and I'm happy to support a family business while they sort out the kinks.

There are 3 instructors, all with their own unique style which makes it a nice change and fun to work out.  The workouts are always different and challenging.  The best part to me is all I have to do is show up and give it my all, they have the workout all planned for me, no thinking involved of what do I have to do next.

Unless it's the only thing open and we're dying of hunger, maybe there's a slight chance. And if it weren't for the voucher we got, this restaurant ain't in our list to try when in Vegas, but it was a win-win, good opportunity to try since it's free dinner (with exceptions of: dessert, alcohol, tax, and gratuity)!

We were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed. Our server named Juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should I say was too busy  favoring the group before us. It made it more noticeable after we've eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room. But what the hell, they all does the same, but to be determined to bring quality service, which I felt Juan didn't deliver well. 

I had Brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh! Bucca di Beppo or Bravo's, all located in Hawaii probably could have done a better version. It's pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels (which the only thing I liked), shrimp, and salmon fish that's super untasty! My husband had Surf & Turf Rodizio with ""unlimited"" meat serving and my in-laws had Grilled Salmon and Skirt Steak (not part of this review) while my child had Loaded Cheese Fries (bacon, cheese, sour cream all OTS because we have a picky eater). 

Going back to my husband's food that didn't impress me at all, even if there's different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it, due to lack of consistency. They seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys. Not a big fan of dead carcass (I'm a wannabe plant based dieter), so I can't really attest how good it was for my husband, but I can tell it didn't really pass to his liking the meat choices and service. 

To end the night, we had some confusion with our server Juan. I should have mentioned this beforehand and the server should've done the same with warning us with water charge per person. Like who does that? I guess only Pampas Brazilian Grille! Or the voucher could've printed it too with other exceptions. Plus, the way Juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order! Instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end, he customized the receipt like they're trying to manipulate something. And call me stingy or whatever, but I didn't like the force tipping impression! That's why it's called a tip because it's up to the guest if they think it was well-deserved. At that case, he obviously didn't earn the whole 15% because I had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husband's and child's water just so I can go on with my dinner. Plus it's not even ice cold! They charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle. There was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groups.

Giving it two stars only because it was ""free"" dinner and experiencing the meat serving at a lackluster manner! Go get that voucher as a VISA card instead!",1,V7tDW7E-VRyqPqbGdsuueA,-0.20000000298023224

The atmosphere is like a casual dining spot but the prices we high for the offerings. My wife and I spent almost $80 on 1 small app, 1 dessert and 2 entrees. No drinks.  Both entrees were wrong as if they ran out of food and were plating dishes on the fly with whatever they had. Nothing we ordered came out correct except the water. 

App:  Deviled eggs - good flavor in the filling but the whites were extremely rubbery. 

Entree 1 : Sea bass topped with crab / veg medley.  The Sea bass was good except it didn't come with anything that it was advertised on the menu. It came with fried mashed potatoes instead of the veggies , no crab meat, and had pesto sauce on it. I actually asked for the menu and pointed to what I thought I was getting. They brought my plate back and there was literally about 1/4 of an oz of crab meat. My wife and I just chuckled. 

Entree 2 : salmon and cheesy mashed. Salmon was great, but came with veggies instead of mashed.  Come to find out they ran out of mashed potatoes and we were stuck wth the veggies.  Who runs out of a main side dish at 6:30p?! 

Dessert: PB brownie cheesecake. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND CALORIES! Huge piece but bland and tasted kinda stale. Was also supposed to be topped with Pb cups. It wasn't. By this time we were fed up and just asked for the check.   We have NEVER not finished a dessert. We took it home and even the kids thought it was bad. 

Service: average at best. Everyone had super awkward personalities and it was painful to have a conversation. Our waitress seemed to be frustrated with everything. She would ask us how we are doing and then walk away while we were answering. We waited for silverware on 2 different occasions.

Don't get me wrong with this, it's a very beautiful and impressive property, but what happened after I left, can't be forgiven.  It's appalling, and I feel like I've been personally violated by the whole ordeal.

When my Credit Card Bill came, I noticed 2 charges from ""Mandalay Bay"".  I called to find out what the second charge was about and found out that I had apparently been charged over $100 for things from the private bar.   

I travel a lot, and know better than to touch anything in the overpriced bar, when there's the same exact stuff down stairs for much cheaper.  When I asked for a receipt of the itemized charges to be emailed to me.  I never received it.  I called twice to have it emailed, and twice they said they'd do it, and they wouldn't, so I disputed the charge through my Credit Card company.

30 days later, my Credit card was able to receive a copy of the itemized list and below were the items they pretty much made up out of thin air.  

--- half of this stuff, i don't even know what it is.  A ""CD?""  what the heck.  What would i play it in?  Who plays a CD in Vegas?   I stayed in the room with brothers and sisters, what would I do with a ""Love Kit"".   

The only thing I could think of would be the personnel taking everything before tidying up the room, and blaming it on me....how would you dispute that?

4 bottles of Fiji water ($5)
1 Pringles Sour cream ($5)
2 Orange Juice ($4)
1 CD ($10)
1 Travel Kit ($15)
1 Love Kit ($30)
2 Cranberry Juice ($4)

In the end I couldn't do anything because they had my credit card on file for ""incidental"" charges. -- something that's industry standard, but to Arbitrarily charge for everything that was in the room, even if it wasn't used is absolutely NOT standard at all.  It's Shady!

I come to Vegas a lot and have stayed in a good handful of hotels on the strip and have never had any other Hotel chain do this.    From the budget friendly Imperial Palace, to even their very own newest 5 star, the Aria hotel, and not ONCE did any of them try this nonsense.  

For the many conferences and personal visits to Vegas I shall make, in the future, I will never, ever stay at the Mandalay or TheHotel again.  It's managed by Shady people.",2,poN3MHVHU41zVV6sCheuZQ,-0.20000000298023224

This is how the story goes:

My girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8/26 to watch the Mayweather/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get ""unexpectedly"" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd. 

At this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. 

So we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow. 

So then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.

It's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone. 

So officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins.....

In fact, when I was growing up my parents had an independent bookstore. I am someone that is always buying books. Shortly before Christmas I drove to The Bookshop intending on buying books as Christmas Gifts. I do not smoke in my car and wait until I get somewhere to light up outside. While having my cigarette I was looking through the windows of ""The Bookshop"" prior to entering. The store was empty of customers as usual. A man inside saw me looking at the merchandise through the windows and in a most obnoxious voice came out and told me not to smoke in front of his store.  His arrogant manner and tone of voice implied that I was some sort of vagrant because I was a smoker. I told him ""You just lost a customer."" Every time I go past there to go to Dick's Hideaway to eat I never see anybody in his book store.  In fact, the other merchants in that strip plaza say they do not know how The Bookshop pays its rent as they never see anybody in there.  I might also add that while looking in the windows I noticed a sign inside the book store that said ""Pets Welcome.""

I have had several procedures done here and have been absolutely pleased with everything.  The overall experience from the front desk to Dr. Hall, to Evelyn the aesthetician has been wonderful.  Everyone is friendly, the facility is state of the art and the results are AMAZING.

I spend a lot of time in the sun and have experienced severe sun damage, primarily the ugly brown sun spots that connect and take over your skin!  After consultations regarding what I hoped to achieve I was given suggestions on what would work best for my skin.  This was done at first with Shannon.  She is terrific!  Very down to earth and funny. This really puts you at ease as you discuss procedures and financials; also important, given that these procedures are obvious luxuries for most people .  There is no high pressure sales and they always point you to promotions that might be coming up and how to get the most bang for your buck. 

Evelyn, the aesthetician is wonderful.  Very friendly, puts you at ease and really knows her business.   As I stated, I do have a lot of sun damage that has reared its ugly head in middle age. I will need to have more treatments done, but due to my outside activity I have to schedule it around times I will be inside a lot (summer).  After 3 treatments, there is a noticeable difference in my skin.  Many of the very prominent dark brown spots are completely gone off of my face and my chest area is almost completely clear!  It truly takes years off of your skin; which shouldn't be important but it is!

I have also had lipo on my previous  ""baby"" region. I'm of average height and weight but after children even diet and exercise couldn't get rid of that belly bump.  The results are amazing, no more pooch or ""jiggly"" area.  Do I look 20 again?  No, but that's not the purpose.  My interaction with Dr. Hall from the consultation to the actual procedure was excellent.  He gives you a realistic view of what you can achieve with the procedure. No false promises. He said that I had enough elasticity in my skin that it would shrink back after the procedure and he was absolutely correct.   He is kind and has an excellent bedside manner that is all but forgotten in today's world.  

I am very pleased with all the results and will be returning here for future laser resurfacing.  I recommend this facility to everyone.",1,sJBIwUCbDydz3Y1NTS_cmA,0.30000001192092896

The salesperson was pleasant to work with and we were able to get the vehicle out the door for the price we needed and the paperwork process was very quick.  

Within the 15 day warranty period we did have an issue with the vehicle.  However, we contacted the dealership and worked with Patrick.  He was very helpful and the problem was corrected in an acceptable amount of time.  He returned calls quickly and worked with us to resolve the issue.

Everything was explained prior to the appointment (procedure, insurance, etc.). There are no long waits once you arrive for your appointment and everyone is friendly and courteous.  You are not rushed through appointments and he answers ALL of your questions without making you feel like you are on the clock.

Dr. Guyette is very caring and shows a great deal of compassion as he performs the procedure.  As noted previously, by other patients, he personally calls you to see how you are doing after surgery; this really is unheard of these days.  After receiving the test results from the biopsy Dr. Guyette's diagnosis was absolutely correct and enough tissue was removed so that we didn't have to go back to have additional work done. The cancer was right below the neck area so it was highly visible.  It's completely healed and unless you are really looking or know it was there the stiches are nearly UNDETECTABLE!   Beautiful work......for anyone who may be considering any other procedures.   

As a side note, we have also been to the Scottsdale office; both facilities are lovely. Our daughter had cystic acne when she was younger.  We originally had gone to a dermatologist and didn't like the treatment that had been prescribed; a prescription that had a lot of side effects we were not willing to risk.  Long story short, we took her to Dr. Guyette's Scottsdale office and through skin treatments, approximately 3 (laser) and using the Obaji line of products her skin completely cleared!  It's been almost 9 years, she continues to use the skin regimen they suggested and her skin has remained cystic acne free.  She did have some slight scarring from the acne but thanks to the IPL treatments it really is minimal and undetectable with very little make up.

We never hesitate to recommend either facility.",0,sJBIwUCbDydz3Y1NTS_cmA,0.30000001192092896

Unfortunately our experience wasn't everything we expected it to be. The main issues that we had was that our countertop was cut into two pieces to fit together, which sounded fine. But they cut a straight line instead of the typical angled line that you see. The straight line makes it so much easier to see. AND the worst part is that the color is so off its extremely obvious to see the line. We just feel that an effort to match the colors at the line should have been made. A few minor issues is that the countertops didn't fit the walls because our walls weren't straight. Which of course isn't Stabella's problem, but the sales rep initially told us that if this happened on sight the installers would just cut the wall a little to slide the counter tops in so everything would be flush with the wall. But when the installers got there they said they couldn't do that because the line (where the two pieces were cut and were supposed to meet) wouldn't be flush. We also decided not to get a backsplash because the sales rep talked us into how ""new"" and ""modern"" looking it would be. But then when we ran into the problems with the wall not being straight we wish we had just ordered the backsplash to hide the issues in the wall. Once again, that's not Stabella's fault that our wall wasn't straight but we just wish the sales rep had been a little more realistic instead of making everything seem like roses and daisies. In the end this left us feeling dissatisfied because we expected different things based on the initial sales pitch. Going back to the line where the two pieces met and one side was much darker than the other, they told us that the granite cutters were instructed to put the darker piece in be back. So what that told me is that Stabella was 100% aware of the drastic change in color while they were cutting our granite ... And the didn't care or even think that would bother us? They just sent it out to be installed at our house anyways. They offered to have an installer come out and apply a darkening agent to the lighter side..but why wasn't this done when the granite was still in their factory being cut? It would have saved everyone a lot of trouble and things would have been done right in the first place. We declined having them come back out to apply the darkening agent because we were worried it would end up looking worse and then we'd really be screwed. Let me add that after we notified them we were declining their offer to come out and darken the countertops, we NEVER heard from them again. We NEVER at any point in the process heard an apology that we weren't 100% satisfied, they never bothered to reassure us that their work would look great after they applied the darkening agent and they'd really like to make it right...nothing. Long story short, I would never recommend Stabella and we've even gone so far as to give their name to some acquaintances and say they're who we recommend you NOT use.

So I go to buy my dress, and the sales associate tells me that the dress is on sale for almost half the price. Great! I was ecstatic.

Well, as she look in the computer system to actually place the order, she finds that the dress is discontinued in extra long. So basically, she lied to my bride when she told her that the dress could be ordered in extra long. So I'm polite and say that it's fine and I'll just order the regular length and it will just be short on me - well then they tell me that I owe an additional $50, because the regular length dress was not on sale. I asked to speak to the manager to see if she would honor the discounted price, since that is what they told me that I would be owed. And the manager was extremely rude and would not honor that discounted price. Super bad customer service. First, they lied to my bride - the dress was not available in extra long. They lied to me - they didn't order the dress, and it never would have been caught if I didn't ask them to confirm the date that it would be in. And then they wouldn't honor the lower price of the discontinued dress. Honoring the regular length dress at the extra length dress's price would have made me feel a whole lot better about the situation. They basically said ""sorry, it's not available.""

He beat out all the other prices that we had gotten, and with the assurance of wonderful online reviews we decided to go with him. He took the truck a few days later and had the body work done in about 6 days - really quick compared to other body shops we had dealt with in the past. The truck looked amazing after the body work, it was affordable, and it was done in a timely manner. We also had some brake work done while the body work was being done, and that went well.

The prices have gone through the roof since she opened her tiny studio in Uxbridge, and all it is now is a money grab; Franchise?? really?

Franchises are normally sold once you have a PROVEN idea that works-not just for the owner, but for hte clients and the franchisees. I have been with you since thestart, and am so frustrated now, that I am no longer saying nice things to people about the experiences there.

In short:
1.focus is money; one on one with Shasta used to be $50 now they are $100-$145/hour-did you get a medicl degree we are not aware of?
2.Calls herself a Transformational and life coach; where did you get your psychology degree?I have known her for years and do not recall any of htese things, only selling more positive karma for $$$$.
3.franchise a business that has no showers, change rooms, blaring music and chatting instructors when we are trying to wind down and get over cancer treatments, divorce, pain and general distress over our lous lives; try to complain and they do not care-too busy to care!
4. Telling people that being registered with the CRA for tuition is like getting FREE training; that is NOT how our tax syste, works-it is a tax deduction, not a wage deduction like an RRSP-this is a blatant lie.
5. the majorityof the instructors have come through their own BLY training and have little to no anatomy outside of htis course; One shoule NEVER do compression of the back/core or extreme Flexion within 45 minutes of waking up-there is still too much fluid ont he disks-WHY don't your instructors know that???
6. Education must be broader; ensure they know that they CANNOT do forceful or any other hands on to clients without asking! A rape victom in child's pose does NOT want hands on her back pushing her further into a stretch-WHAT was she thinking?
7. Instructors SHOULD NOT tell clients before a class that hey should come more regularly in order to ""get rid of the rest of that belly"". Someone with an eating disorder, struggling for years, does not want to hear this-Actually NOBODY should ever have to hear that from anyone! Disrespectful. We thought that BLY was a safe place, but we gues it no longer cares about anything except money.

While standing in the area by the spring water, my 2yo was fussing. I noticed a customer and the cashier looking at us. The customer shook her head and turned back to the cashier and made a motion with her hand smacking her lips. The cashier laughed and made a motion cupping one hand and back hand smacking the cupped hand with his other hand. They looked at us again and the customer kept talking while she was frowned up. 

I went to them and said I know you're not implying I smack my child. They just looked; the customer still frowned up. As I walked away my friend still stood there and said they kept looking at us while making comments. 

After this we spoke with the supervisor who claimed she was the highest in rank there. She seemed to not care because she said I'll talk to him nonchalantly. She said I could go online to get in touch with the corporate office since I wasn't satisfied with her response. She also gave us a card and pen to fill out with comments about the store only to later come back and say she needed the pen back because that was the only one they had. 

Before leaving we talked with a cashier who pointed out the manager to us. Then the cashier who was making the motions with his hands came to where we were and started talking to us saying he has a 5yo so he knows how children act up. Obviously the supervision said something to him. He had an attitude and said he wouldn't be talking to a customer about another customer and we had mistaken the whole thing. 

Once leaving we talked to the manager about the hand gestures the cashier and customer made. He said he's worked with the cashier for years and he wouldn't do anything like that. He claimed the cashier smacks his hands a lot while talking and that when he came over to us told he apologized for his hand gestures. I told the manager our conversation was over because the cashier never mentioned anything about his hand gestures and only had excuses, not an apology. 

It's nice to know that the Whole Foods staff sticks together no matter what from the top on down. I will find out if Corporate sticks by this kind of foolishness. 

Oh... Before I left I saw the cashier pushing the supervisors cart to her car and they were chatting it up for a while.",2,MmOlteGoOLp4uydXpW7EHg,-0.30000001192092896

I asked the girl working at the reception if an appointment was neccessary for a cut and colour. She informed me that no, an appointment was not needed. She was nice, cheerful and informative. She told me about the current specials as well. I said that I would return the following day. 
The next day, I returned to this location at 5:30 with a friend. We both said that we wanted a colour and cut. It was the same girl working at the front desk. She was disappearing, on and off the phone, and otherwise out to lunch - so to speak. She gave us forms to fill out with our contact information and told us it was an hour to an hour and a half wait - Really, no appointments? She then got on the phone and made herself unavailable. My friend and I stood there waiting for someone to assist us. Eventually, the instructor, who had been busy doing another sudent's highlights in plain view, came over to take our forms and she said she would call us when our spot was open. 
My friend and I went to some shops in the plaza to kill time. 6:45 rolls around and we still hadn't gotten a call. We went back into the school (I don't want to call it a salon...) and let the front desk staff know we were back. We waited until 7... Nothing. They wouldn't even give us an estimate on the time. They said there were two people ahead of us. I struck up conversation with a woman who was also waiting. She said she also came in arounf 5:30 - for a ROOT TOUCH UP - and was STILL waiting. She made a good point... she could have gone home and done it herself in that time. I approached the desk around 7:15 and spoke to a student, the same student who was getting highlights done in her own hair earlier. She told me that as soon as she was done - and pointed to her own hair - she would help me. Um... ok.
At 7:30, we were still not served or given a time that we would be. I approached the desk and informed them we had been waiting 2 HOURS and that this was entirely unacceptable and bullsh-t. The same instructor that was doing highlights on the student earlier had only said ""I do apologize."" I told her she should be teaching these students professionalism and correct customer service, neither which was present in this place.  I also let her know that I completely understood that this was a SCHOOL and not a salon, and that I therefore knew it would be a little slower but that it was common sense to let their customers know what was going on as we had been waiting. she kept saying ""I do apologize""... nothing else. I asked once again what the time frame for waiting would be. She then said half an hour to an hour. I asked her if she was for real... to which she said yes. I then told her we are NOT waiting three hours for this... and told her to dispose of our contact sheets that we initially filled out. I told her, now with an audience of two students - one who was the girl working the front desk - that I had attended this location the previous day and thought the prices, staff and reviews looked good. I told her I had recommended this location to my friends and family to check out. I then explained that I would retract that and that I would never recommend it again.

I'm thinking of a Moroccan feel, very aromatic/herbally, and very calming music.  I also imagined separate rooms for each service offered...What I had received is this..
 
Entering on the 2nd floor of a very old building, into just a regular room with a high chair/foot rest on one end and the manicure station next to it.  Also in the room was the Moroccan sit down/waiting room along with the front desk.  So this small room consist of all of the setting described above.  Then in another room was the facial station/massage station separated by a curtain.
I wouldn't have such an issue with the setting but I did have an issue with the experience/professionalism of the service. Please see below:
 
1)  The short hand and toe fix is just taking off our nail polish and clipping it down.  Followed by continuous filing on your nails that actually was unnecessary because it was already to the skin part of the nail (that really hurt).  Also my cousin had stated that she had extra skin that is near her fingernail so it was already cut to wear she wanted it but the owner insisted she knew what she was doing and that she will cut it.  On top of it, she did not massage my hands nor my foot.  Shows that she really doesn't listen to her customers.  What is nice was the paraffin feet and hand that she provided.
 
2) Then we went into the massage/facial room.  I was given the back scrub first and my cousin was given the facial.  My back scrub was fine.  My cousin's facial was fine for the most part.  Now the funny thing is, so she gave me 20 minutes to relax and then came into the room to wake me up.  I do not think her assistant knew what she was doing for she kept asking the owner what to do.  Then, she told me I had to go shower!  What????  So she stood there in the massage room while I was naked trying to get on my robe (weird). So...she took me to a bathroom down the hall..the bathroom was so disgusting and I had to get up in the stand up shower to rinse off my back  and the paraffin hand/foot treatment.  While I was in the gross disgusting stand up shower, barefoot-keep in mind, the woman opens the door and asks if everything is okay.  Who does that??
 
3) After the shower, I came back and sat in the massage room.  She told me to lay down again and she gave me I guess at most a 15 minute ""moroccan massage""-which was not relaxing at all.  And on top of that her hands slipped and punched me in the cheeks.
 
4) Facial was okay.  I don't think the towel they put on me was a clean towel.  I felt like it was the same towel that was probably from my feet.  The facial was nothing spectacular and it did not serve it's justice.
 
I really, really had a bad experience with this massage place.  I feel mostly bad for my cousin because she's never been to a day spa.  What she experienced is not a good impression of what a dayspa should really be.  She was not a licensed massage therapist but yet she wants to do all services.  If you are not experienced..you should not do it.  It says on there she was a licensed podology.  She kept pushing her product line and repeatedly informed her that we were not interested.  At one point, I told her I was from the states and that I was flying home so I wouldn't be able to carry all the products onto the plane.  She suggested that I send it through the post office..ummm I don't think so.  It would cost alot of money to send out of the country.  And last but not least her hidden fees.  So I guess this living social deal did not include the taxes.  She charged 13% for Canadian taxes and then an automatic service fee (which I think is a bunch of bullshit since it was crappy services) of 17%.  So we already paid 99.00 for the services and then forced 30.00 for fees/services?  Really??  

I don't think I will be going back....",0,ZRqLxkrnP1T8dVCs26X41Q,-0.20000000298023224

Good sushi, fair price, discount of takeout, what's not to like? 

Yesterday, I went there for my usual Love Boat take out order and I noticed that huge price jump. The price for the Love Boat B was 45.99 and it's now 62.99. I was initially confused by it and then realized that they've changed all menus. Looked around and the restaurant is now empty without any take out order then everything started to click and I know why. 

Since I have to wait for the order to come, I went back to my car and grabbed the old menu and went back to the restaurant to compare with the new prices. The lady came by and took my old menu away! Sneaky sneaky

If anyone has any recommendations to any other comparable sushi restaurant, it would be greatly appreciated. $17 price jump on the same order is not cool. As much as I love sushi, I'm not paying that.

I asked if I could get my hair washed prior to my haircut and she quickly said, ""You can or you don't have to, it's five dollars extra if you want your hair washed,"" and I said yes that's fine. She responded in a way as if it were an inconvenience for her to wash my hair as she directed me to the sink.
Fast forward to the hair cut: as he was cutting my hair, he kept looking away and glancing at the door as he snipped my hair!! My hair ended up looking choppy and uneven. I was so upset with the results, but I didn't want to cause a scene and just paid quickly in order to leave asap.The woman's demeanor quickly changed and she was all of sudden super nice and polite as I pulled out my payment.
If you're wondering, no it has nothing to do with the language barrier, because I'm Vietnamese as well! They were just incredibly rude and unprofessional. Poor quality hair cut and poor attitudes. I thought the other reviews were more honest, but I think it's inaccurate. I probably could have gotten a better haircut and service from a student stylist.",2,DP5euJjaNH0Ffte0-ZO8cw,-0.20000000298023224

I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. 
 After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. 
Most sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10"" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4""x6"". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews.

As for the expense, its organic as you can get, but thats the Navajo food way, and not advertised and used as a gimmick, like the american food way, hence, its a bit more in cost. An example is, the mutton (sheep) is bought on the Navajo Nation. Navajo's know tis because we cantaste the difference, between a sheep raised on Navajo land vegetation and sheep not raised on it.

I pointed out to him that it was a Best Buy floor person that recommended the router, but he would not take the product back.

Given that I spent a couple thousand dollars at Best Buy (two computers) over the past six months, plus I am a ""Rewards Member"", I guess I was expecting too much.

I wound up going to Target to purchase a new router.  It is my intention to avoid buying anything further from Best Buy, given they do not back the products they sell.

For completeness:  Working with Belkin was no better.  it took two phone calls and three associates to get an RMA, which is going to be more of a hassle than it is worth.

I decided on this awesome place due to reviews here and the pics they've uploaded. It's obvious these ladies know color and I was fairly certain they could pull off a faux hawk with shaved sides. :P
After thinking about it and pondering for over a year I finally decided I'd get my dream hair. Walked in to score an appointment for my day off and got Shannon- who penciled me in and seemed interested in what I wanted. :) Which immediately made me feel better. She was very sweet, funny and professional throughout the whole appointment, listened to what I had in mind, looked at the pics I had for vague reference and created my vision with 100% accuracy. My god. I've never been so in love with myself. Everyone- even my fairly conservative parents- say it's gorgeous and is totally ME. 
It's been a week now and I've washed it twice- color is still a strong aqua/teal. -love- And people are STILL complimenting me. 
This place is as laid back as everyone says. Like a tattoo shop for your hair. Will forever come back.

He was just very honest that my regular polish would likely chip within a few days at the beach.  I appreciated his honesty. And while I agreed about the gel, I opted to stick with regular polish knowing full well that I'll probably have to touch it up myself. At the end of the day, a regular polish manicure just isn't going to be as long lasting as a gel or acrylic manicure. That's why it's $17 instead of $37. ?

It didn't feel very hearty to me as there wasn't many chunks of clams or potatoes or what have you. Though, It's a pretty decent chowder. 

* Haddock and chips: I'm not a big fan of the fish and chips here at buster's. The batter is light, but it doesn't have much taste to it. The batter was also not crispy. The haddock itself, is a little dry. I was expecting it to be a tougher texture, but it shouldn't feel dry. Also not much seasoning. Kind of reminds me of fish filets/fish sticks that come in a box in the frozen aisle. The fries, were definitely not made fresh (even with the lineup?!). They weren't crispy nor too soggy. Saving grace was their tartar sauce, it tasted home made and gave the fish some flavour. It also comes with a little container of slaw.

Ok back to the food!

The Mochi (2.50$): We ordered the black sesame Mochi but the girl gave me the red bean instead :'(. It's made with actual sticky rice! So it wasn't that sweet and kind of a little savoury in fact! Wasn't what I expected! It was interesting.

The taro ice cream ($4.50): the first spoon of taro ice cream brought me back to childhood memories of having taro ice cream in HK!! Which means it was very good, albeit a bit on the sweeter side. It comes in a plastic bowl with lid, not bad for price.

So my boy and I saw the travel channel burger special on this joint a week before we went to Vegas and we were all like "" YO CUZ WE GOTS TO EATS THESE MEATS"". So the morning after our first rage session we  were the first customers in line when it opened. There was also an obnoxious German film crew trying to shoot in their restaurant. After being rude to one of the lovely waitresses and refusing to wear the awesome patients gown we got to experience probably the greatest tongue lashing I've ever witnessed. Dr.Jon came over and told the German douche bags what they could do with the hospital gowns if they didn't like them. Dr. Jon is a true american hero in my opinion because like any good American he knows what happens if you let a pushy German get their way. His vision of american  badassness is a shining beacon of our freedom and should be commended. The burgers, fries, and shakes are  tasty, the waitresses are friendly ,beautiful and playful. If you're downtown you owe it to America to eat here.

  p.s. Dr. Jon if you ever read this know that you are awesome and I am now and forever your biggest fan.  Everyone I ever speak to that is heading to vegas will hear my tale of how my hero Dr. Jon vanquished the snotty Euro film crew sent here to mock our American right to do whatever the f%#ck we want to. I will eat here every time I visit Vegas until I die.


Just revisited this American gem and it was every bit as good as the last time. God bless America and and God bless the good men and women of the Heart attack Grill.

Hungry, we finally arrived to Indie Ale House. To our dismay, the kitchen was closed from 3 to 5 pm; however, the greeter suggested Playa Cabana Cantina across the street for some good eats. What a suggestion that turned out to be.

The prices were a little higher for a typical burrito, but in my opinion, I got what I paid for. I ordered the CARNE MOLIDA PICADILLO BURRITO which is home-ground beef slow-cooked with guajillo-ancho-chipotle. The burrito had a beautiful presentation with green ancho-chili sauce poured on one half with a red, tomatoe sauce poured on the other half. Their sauces were fantastic. They also offered two house-made hot sauces. One was a habenero based hot sauce and the other was a hot sauce made from smoked chilis. Both sauces had a great spice. The smoked hot sauce went great with my dish.

My wife bought the Tres taco option - ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS. This took traditional tacos to another level. As mentioned, Playa Cabana has their sauces down. The liquid in which they braised the short rib was no exception. This option paired extremely well with the habenero hot sauce.

If you are in the area and have no problem with $14-18 for a delicious entre, by all means, try it out. (Not to mention Indie Ale House is right across the street with tastey brews for a good night cap.) When in Toronto again, I will defintely come back.",0,EkOZKVkzlVJ49Jr1tPBApw,0.30000001192092896

Next came the salads. These were made up of a few greens and half a tomato. Seriously?

Interior is nice, airy spacious, a bit loud and echoey with upstairs seating. Not exactly a cozy intimate dinner spot, still retains that fast-foody 'get in, eat, get out' atmosphere of most places on Green.

In order to get a good cross-sample I ordered the mixed grill. Wait was a solid 15 minutes, and there was a steady trickle of customers the whole time (during spring break, I imagine they will be busier during school). The menu said they had hot tea but I saw none in evidence, just a soda fountain, cold bottle drinks behind the counter, and an iced tea server.

Got the food to go and got back to the office. The chicken (shish tawook) was perfectly done, which for white meat at an understaffed restaurant (they had help wanted signs in the window) is a mark in their favor. The beef was also well done and mildly flavorful but not quite the explosion of spiciness that Layalina provides. The kufta kabob was also mild and well-cooked. Nothing was dry or tasteless, the pita bread was fresh, the two sides they give you, one was some kind of jerusalem salad that was 90% tomatoes so I passed on it after taking one bite for review purposes (yup, tomtaoey. Yuck. The things I do for you people) and the other was this odd, neon-pink pickled... something. Not cabbage, not radish, not sure what it was. Its not on the menu. I ate it anyway. It was... pickled radishy but not too strong. Serving sizes were more than enough for lunch unless you're super hungry, I was and still felt full about halfway in but it was good enough that by picking at it over the course of an hour I managed to finish everything but the pita.

The rice was a little on the oily side but good if again, not as spiced as Layalina. All in all this was a nice, freshly-cooked, healthy meal for a great price. I've heard the owners are Afghani so its possible the food is a milder form than I'm used to. Either way it was fresh, hot, tasty and a great deal for the price. I wouldn't do a dinner date here or anything but for a casual nice lunch or dinner that's not the same fast food fare, I definitely recommend it.",1,qnMR9YDAZuWP1ufBM_pKhg,0.0

If you ever wonder what happened to the food there, it was this: the cook sold it and left. He's now opened a new place and the food's just as good as I remembered it. 

Had the dry-fried string beans, some stir-fried beef and mixed veg dish, the mix platter appetizer and some beef noodle soup. All were quite flavorful and tasty, and not too oily (something that happens often in this town with Chinese food, sadly). Could not stop eating the green beans, even my four year old liked them. For those who use this metric for their Chinese restaurants: every other patron there was native Chinese, both students and older folk. Parking is free, easy and plentiful. 

As others have said, the interior is the exact same (they even still have the beanbag toss game out on the patio and the 'lucky' rock in the lobby from when it was Rock's) just with a bunch of tables thrown in but I'm sure that'll change as it gets established.
The serving staff was efficient (might have to point at the menu item you're ordering) and quick with the food, which was piping hot and obviously freshly made, and quite friendly with my son when he practiced his Chinese on them.

Cheaper than other Indian places in the area but due to the small location size less variety of food as well (half the buffet table is salad bar/dessert/sauces), so it evens out. Nice touch: they weigh the buffet takeout, so you don't have to pay the full price if you don't load up.

Naan: just ok, but I did get takeout so it might've suffered a bit in transit. Naan is best fresh and hot.

veggie korma: very good, nicely spicy, good flavor, vegetables were good quality.

pekora: nicely crunchy even after sitting in a styrofoam box for a few minutes, little salty.

palak chana: good, nicely spicy and flavorful, right thickness of sauce

kidney bean chickpea thing I forget the name of: kind of bland, I usually expect more fire in this dish.

tandoori chicken: not great, surprisingly. It was dry and surprisingly hot (spice wise) while being less flavorful than I'm used to. Maybe it'd just been sitting around for awhile (its hard to make dark meat dry!)

lemon rice: yellow rice with fried peanuts in it. I liked the peanuts, gave it a nice crunch, but didn't really taste anything else flavor wise; could've just been plain old basmati rice.

chicken curry: ok, this is why this place dropped a full star. The chicken curry is bone in, which would be fine if it were whole bone, but the bone is cleaver-chopped, which leaves tiny shards of barely-detectable bone EVERYWHERE. Seriously I was picking through this thing like I was dissecting in a lab to make sure I didn't kill myself with every bite. I don't even remember how it tasted. I realize this is 'authentic' but so is using a cow-dung oven to make naan and I'm betting they don't do that. Debone your chicken curry, you're gonna get sued.

The interior decor is really quite nice (a huge change from when it was Wonderdogs, you won't recognize the place), the music wasn't too loud, there was a refreshing lack of tv blaring in the corner, the proprietors are very nice and conscientious, and things were moving along well in such a tight space (you're not going to like it at lunch rush if you're claustrophobic/have a phobia of strange people bumping up against/brushing by you). The vegetarian dishes are better than the meat dishes, and I didn't try everything available on the lunch buffet (two or three more items, a lentil soup, desserts (mango custard sounds really good but I didn't want to mingle flavors).

Feels like the vegetarian dishes were better than the meat-based ones, and there is plenty of vegetarian on offer. Wish they'd add samosas to the buffet.

We arrived on Easter Sunday to a clean facility, short line and speedy assistance.  The counter rep was friendly and helpful,  and we were welcomed with a courteous greeting and bottles of cold water when we went downstairs to pick up our car.  Another rep showed us several cars  to choose from and answered our questions with patience and professionalism.  Returning the car was just as easy.

I removed one star because the rep made a point of emphasizing that Arizona is a ""no-fault"" state and we'd be liable for lost use of the car if it landed in the shop, regardless of whether the other driver was at fault.  With over $200 in added insurance and a $10 a day upgrade, our original weekly rental of $197 burgeoned into well over $525.  

I don't blame Enterprise - we should have researched our liability in advance.  But they do prey upon travelers' anxiety when they're eager to hit the road and start their vacations.  It's a scam.",7,742Gsec3pKTQ7z0BYI_DrQ,0.10000000149011612

DO NOT use this company!  An estate sale is usually held at a time of stress, death, or moving to a retirement home, when you are vulnerable. That was not my situation, but she CANNOT BE TRUSTED with your family belongings!  Both houses were complete turn-key rentals with all furniture, décor, household goods, linens, etc.  Some of the items were exquisite, especially compared to the other sales shown on her website. There was a mix of things and various quality and values.  I had already conducted three of my own estate sales for other vacation homes that my company was emptying out, and I didn't have time to do another sale. I made a lot of money at my own sales, and I know what stuff sells and what doesn't.  I am also an avid estate/garage sale shopper, so I do know prices. I was going out of town, so I thought this was a great idea - WRONG!  I feel scammed and robbed.  So many things went wrong -- I can't possibly list them all here.  Numerous people told me later that they had been at the sale and said it was very disorganized, nothing was priced, she was on the phone all the time, was just stuffing money into her overalls and not accounting for anything at all!  She doesn't say what she sold major items for (even though I had set minimum prices), provides no accounting whatsoever, and she brought over a lot of her own JUNK to sell.  I think she keeps stuff left over from other sales  (she says she donates it), and then she sells it and pockets the money herself, mixing up the funds of her clients.  Damage was done to both houses from people moving furniture, the carpets were filthy, and items were stolen, including a fixture from the shower!  There were only 3 people working both houses and she had told me there would be 5 -- 2 people at each house, plus herself.  How else could you make sure people weren't stealing stuff, if there is no one there watching?!  Something doesn't add up about this company, and I cannot believe she is still in business.  She also doesn't tell you what the extra fees will be for signs, email blasts, etc.  Very deceptive.",16,f638AHA_GoHbyDB7VFMz7A,-0.30000001192092896

I made the reservation online and paid with a credit card.  When I checked in, I was told that because I am a local, they thought I might be having a PARTY in the room, so there would be a $250 PER NIGHT security deposit, for a total of $750.  I am a single 58 year old woman, not a 21 year old party animal!  The $750 was charged to my credit card, not as a hold, but as an actual charge, and it will take several days after check-out to be credited back to my card.  I did not rent a big suite and the room I had was certainly not big enough to have a party.  The Palms is known for their big party suites--why else would you rent a big party suite if you were NOT going to have a party?  According to their logic, locals might have a party in their room, but tourists pack 6 guests in their basic small room and that is NOT a party?  It's the tourists that come here to party!  If I wanted to have a party, I would have it at my house, not a small hotel room with no refrigerator!  Why was the security deposit $250 PER NIGHT?  Obviously, when the maid cleaned the room after the first and second day, she could see that I had not had a party there the night before.  I am thoroughly insulted and will not stay at the Palms again for my next staycation.  Also, the resort fee of over $30 is a joke.  I know all the hotels here do it, but why is that legal?  Since it is not an optional charge, it should be part of the room rate.  It doesn't even include decent WiFi.

We're talking maybe 3 inches in diameter.

Nachos are not served with anything, guacamole, sour cream and salsa is all extra. Guacamole is also listed as ""Market price""? Weird. Steak tacos were cold and chewy.

Beware the service--likely from the owner. After our nachos he came by, tossed all of our food to the right of the table without saying anything (he knocked over the bowl of guacamole and shoved my arm in the process) and then promptly sat a family of four...right at our table. I've never experienced something so incredibly awkward and bizarre. He took our water jug, put it on their side, then took our water glasses--which I drank out of--and put it in front of them. That family somehow got their tacos before we did, ate, left, then another group of 3 came and were seated right at our table--elbow to elbow--again.

But this place deserves due credit. While a few other mothers and I were sitting across the hall watching our FOUR YEAR OLD children from a room equipped with tv screens we hear coach Shauna bellow in a very loud deep tone &quot;I told you 4 times to get over here and pay attention&quot; and I'm talking like shes yelling at grown men in a barroom or something absurd. Completely startled we all glance at each other wondering if that really just happened. Followed by 2 other moms I walk to the room, concerned. When i asked Coach Shauna what was wrong she told me that the girls were just not listening. I told her that if she ever has a problem with my daughter to send her out of class, that i am always in the other room and that i do not approve of her yelling at her. the other mothers also voiced their concern in which Coach Shauna replied &quot;if you dont want your kid in my class they don't have to be&quot; Hello?! Last I knew I payed to have my kid in this class and never once did I sign her up to be disciplined especially in that manner! After requesting to speak with the manager about the incident and them returning my call after they reviewed the tape i was informed that they cant have the class disrupted. I am not about letting my daughter be rude and I am more than proud knowing that she is a very polite and respectful little girl, but these are FOUR year old kids Coach Shauna is dealing with and if she doesnt have the patients to teach four year olds then she shouldn't be! i'm also pretty sure they are suppose to be having fun and they are not training for the olympics.

After staying there for one year, keeping the place clean, and finishing my MBA at Thunderbird, I moved out (along with my roommate).  We made an appointment to meet with the maintenance personnel to do a walk-through of the place before leaving because we had heard that the complex was unfairly keeping people's security deposits.  After the walk-through, the maintenance person said everything was fine.  The carpet was vacuumed and everything was clean.  Then, 3 weeks later I get my security deposit notice-  that they have taken my deposit and they want me to pay $75.00 beyond it.  

Management told me there was nothing I could do about it.  I also had issues with rude management during an extension of my lease and adding somebody onto the lease.  I escalated the case to rkproperties management and they claimed that they took pictures of stains on carpets.  Also, my roommate had opened the microwave one day and a piece of the top fell off . . .just fell off!  We were told that it was 'damaged' above normal wear and tear and the maintenance personnel's word was the last.  Since when is opening a microwave door 'damage?'  It was probably broken before we even moved in.  Again, we were told that the maintenance personnel had the last word.  Seriously?  This is how you treat part of your largest group of renters, business school students?

We had domestic violence in the apartment below us, ambulances came, they were screaming and yelling and fighting all the time.

I've had their italian sausage sandwich (decent), the philly cheese sandwich (pretty good), pastrami (pretty good) and their chef salad. The chef salad is quite decent but they put these onions on it that look like they were meant to be battered and deep fried for onion rings. They were so large and overpowering that I started requesting to leave them off of the salad. Overall, the food has been decent, but this last time, I decided to get a small order of chili cheese fries. My God, that was a mistake. The chili was obviously out of a can...easily mistaken for dog food (even the smell took me for a loop). The cheese was like cheez-wiz....not appetizing at all. And like many reviewers stated, the fries were soggy. The fries are ALWAYS soggy. They don't punch a hole in the containers to let the steam out so once they're delivered, they are too far gone. 

As for the delivery time, that's absolutely crazy too. For being in a fairly close proximity to their establishment, they sure take a LONG time, even if it's just an order of salads for myself and my co-workers. The delivery guy is different every single time and they are often a bit rude. 

My co-worker ordered the chef salad yesterday, but was told they increased the price by almost $2.00. We unanimously agreed that we'll find some place new to get lunch. 

The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because I can't lie and say they don't have good food, they do. But when you wait well over an hour for your food, you hope it at least tastes good, and when something as easy as chili cheese fries is as egregiously bad as it was yesterday, it's hard to want to eat there again.",0,HtxS3TMKjzlCQINL9FAgzg,-0.30000001192092896

Granted the dealership paid for that repair since the warranty refused to. And the fifth trip to the mechanic was also paid for by the dealer. None the less, when the first problem happened I was told that if trouble persisted I would be placed in a different vehicle. 5 separate trips to the mechanic showed a persisting problem. I wasn't placed in a different vehicle. This vehicle has been nothing but a money pit from the start. I will not be replacing the engine. 
    This vehicle has not been reliable. I felt I was left no other choice but to go and get a new car that is reliable from a reputable dealership. I understand that there are people that have had good experiences with getting a car from good carma. Unfortunately I cannot say my experience was among them.

However, I experienced the worst service at this location which is around St. Patrick's station downtown.  The employee there was so rude.
So, my friend and I came into the store first.  No greeting.  I mean, whatever, nothing too big to complain about.  We were browsing the flavours when two other girls came into the store.  The employee then talked to them and they seemed to be friends.  After two minutes, we were ready to order and the employee was still talking to the two girls for around 5-10 minutes.  She also served them first! (Ha!)  It wasn't until her friend stopped (annoyed) and pointed at us, whispering, apparently signalling for her friend (the employee) to go and serve us.  The employee also looked annoyed that she had to stop her conversation 'cus we wanted to order something... so anyway, we asked her if she had the Cookies & Cream flavour and she just replied, ""No.""  That's it!  and then she went back to her friends.  She didn't even say, ""Sorry"" ""Do you want anything else"" and she didn't even ask my friend who was actually ready to order her Pistachio ice cream.  She just said one word and went back to talk to her friends.  

It was like we weren't even there!  I find it so rude to be treated as if you don't even exist.  It's so much worse than being given attitude...at least the person acknowledges your presence.  I will NEVER go to this location again.  I love Baskin Robbins but I'd rather just walk to the Eaton Centre location than go to this place again!

Well, simply all you can eat sushi is not recommended generally speaking, and its poor selection and robot made like sushi is just out of discussion.   
This place, however, four sushi chefs are working so hard like humming bird and you can eat premium such as uni, amaebi, fatty salmon too on top of regular one and appetizers (those premiums are one order only though).  After you try all others, one time premium sushi is just fine for me.  
Fifth star could be by adding some basic selection I usually can find such as Aji or Kohada, and due to the speedy preparation, the rice isn't treated well sometimes.  Fall apart before you put it in mouth...

I'm a local and come to Oshea's often to see my DJ friends perform. I've been here multiple times, this place is great and I always have a good time. I go there especially for their $3 frozen Baileys.

I walked in around 11 pm on a monday night. 3/28/2016. I was excited to take a friend of mine (who is from out of town) to Oshea's for some drinks and a good time as always. I ordered 2 frozen baileys and handed the bartender a $20 bill. HE DID NOT COME BACK TO GIVE ME MY CHANGE AND SCAMMED ME. When I asked the barback how much my drinks were, he kind of played dumb and said ""I'm not sure, probably $6-$10"" SO I BELIEVE THEY WERE BOTH IN ON IT. I asked the bartender how much the drinks were, and told me $10 each.

At the time , I wasn't sure what the correct price was and believed what he told me . BUT HE STILL DIDNT PRINT ME OUT A RECEIPT TO SHOW ME THE CHARGE! I just finished our drinks and left. When I asked my friends (who is a regular DJ at OSHEAS) he told me there ALWAYS $3!

In regards to the food, I ordered a small pesto pasta and had low expectations. It actually was better than I thought it was going to be. The pasta and tomatoes with it were very fresh. There were supposed to be mushrooms but I think I had one in my entire dish. 

The portion size was so generous I actually thought they had given me a large instead of a small. I was eating with a friend and she ordered the peanut saute which looked very small.

We made reservations for a party of 4 on a Saturday night. Good thing too because the place was packed! I've actually tried to get in to this restaurant without reservations and been turned away because it's so busy. 

The restaurant itself is nicely appointed. We were seated in the back at a cute little booth, allowing us to look out at the whole of the restaurant. 

The service was friendly but a bit slow at times. It seemed that any time we wanted to order (drinks, entrees, and dessert), we had to wait for a fairly long time for our server to notice us. However cleaning up plates was very efficient. 

We also had problems with the restaurant running out of items we wanted. One person in the party ordered their ravioli and was told upon ordering that they were out of it. It really bothers me when restaurants don't tell you up front what they don't have in stock anymore. Otherwise you are happy with your choice and then need to make a split decision because the restaurant doesn't have it.  Two of us were also drinking Coke Zero and they ran out of that half way through the meal too. 

In terms of the food, I've been to this restaurant a few years ago and remember the food being better than this visit. I had the wild cheese tortellini and found it to be a bit bland. My husband had the bolognese which I also found to be a bit bland. The bruschetta was delicious and the tartufo was good as well so it was just the pasta sauces that could have used a bit more salt, or extra oomph.

The schnitzel is my favourite dish there, though sometimes I'll get one of the specials (usually when they have duck or veal). All of the desserts I've had there have been delicious, my favourite being the dobos torte. However since this is apparently a difficult dessert to make, it's unusual that they have it. 

Over the past year, this restaurant has lost most of their regular staff and has seemed to suffer from that. Now that those staff have been around for 6-8 months, they finally seem to be getting in to a groove and service isn't as slow as it was months ago. We've never had unfriendly service here, just slow at times. 

The portion sizes also seem to have decreased a bit. With the schnitzel, I have to ask for extra mushroom sauce because the small cup they serve isn't enough. That said, the price point at this restaurant is very fair. 

There is a patio to sit on, but it's right beside Dundas and can be a bit noisy at times, though it is nice to sit outside.

Bistro Narra seems to do specialty menus every so often, which is great for additional variety. This time it was schnitzel fest. I tried the cordon bleu and it was very easy for me to sub out french fries and sub in parsley potatoes instead. 

When the meal came, it was a tad over-cooked (fried too long), but still delicious. Didn't order dessert this time, but I usually do and it is always good.

The coffee is also delicious and it's one of the few places where you can find a real flat white, just like what you would get in New Zealand. 

The food is too over the top for me. I'd prefer some more simplistic stuff on the menu. If I recall correctly, they used to have a grilled cheese on the menu that was really good but now it seems to only be on the kids menu.

Made reservations for dinner and decided we wanted to sit on the patio so saw very little of the interior of the restaurant. The patio itself is quite small but we were the only people out there and since this restaurant is set back from Lakeshore, it was quite pleasant. 

The food was very good and worthy of more stars. The bread served at the table was incredibly fresh. Since this is a wine bar, there's a decent selection of wines and we tried something we hadn't heard of before. I had the veal chop special which was served with two large and yummy prawns. I wish I had been asked how I liked my veal as it served well done and I prefer more medium rare. For dessert, I had tiramisu which was excellent. 

My problem with this restaurant was the service. Our server was friendly at the beginning but we had a couple of problems. My grandfather is a 93 year old man that can't hear well and can't speak all that clearly. The server misunderstood what he ordered and when utensils were brought out for the food, it was clear there had been a mistake. Instead of apologizing for it, the server got defensive and said that she had repeated the order and no one corrected it. She went back to the kitchen and corrected it, then came out and asked him if he was ok with that. He said of course, because it's what he ordered and she said yes, you better be ok with that. She started off quite friendly, and she ended quite friendly, but this caused some tension. 

My other complaint would be the amount of time it took. From sitting down to being served food it was 45 minutes. Similarly, from ordering desserts to getting them it was about another 15 minutes. I can't comment on how busy the restaurant was because we weren't inside but this still felt lengthy to me.

We like being seated in a booth and usually can unless it's very busy. 

Service, aside from my language problems with the milk tea, is pretty good.

Thank god we had a Groupon deal... I can't imagine paying for this meal full price.

We made reservations and when we arrived 5 minutes early, the waitress looked at us like she had no idea what to do with us. This restaurant is very small - only 10 tables, but there was a table for 4 and a table for 2. I'm not sure what's hard to determine on where to seat 2 people? The waitress had to ask someone else for help on where to seat us. 

Eventually got seated, ordered drinks (pop) and were told the specials. My husband ordered the burger, I ordered their steak special. My first mistake was not asking how much the steak cost. I would have expected a little under $30 and instead it was $34. A little overpriced. The burger is more than fair at $17 and a huge portion. 

The problem with this place is the absolute asinine prices they charge for pop. The two of us each ordered a Diet Coke and then asked for refills. The bill came out to $16 just for the drinks!!! 16 freaking dollars for soda!! We could by 3 cases of pop for this. Instead, we probably had 3 cans between the two of us. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor when I saw this charge. 

In terms of food, it was pretty tasty. 

For service, we had problems getting the refills (maybe we would have been better off if the service had been worse and we didn't get them at all). It also took an hour and 45 minutes for one course. I noticed the table beside us had to ask 3 times for their drink.

I let the Sales person know I was looking at the CT and got some background information on the car before being taken to his desk and asked about whether I wanted to finance or lease. Upon saying finance, the sales rep proceeded to break down all of the costs for leasing and why it's better. I'm just at the beginning stages of looking for cars right now! I don't care about financing vs. leasing. I need to pick a car before I do so.   

The rep finally goes to find us a car to test drive and I'm put in 2011 CT. That's right, a USED car with 80k on it.

Fine, let's test drive this car. Half way through the test drive, the rep gets a call on his phone and says we need to be back at the dealership in 5 minutes because he has another customer waiting.

I was here for lunch, where this restaurant has a fixed price menu (outside of Summer/Winterlicious). I tried this and had a Cesar salad which had nice and creamy dressing, the pappardelle alfredo which was pretty bland, and then a scoop of gelato. The gelato was vanilla and pretty good, however I wasn't allowed to choose what flavour I wanted. Is vanilla the only flavour they have? Overall, a pretty blase meal.

For $24.99 you get an all-you-can-eat brunch - but this isn't your usual Vegas buffet - everything is made to order and served tapas style.  

We started with the fresh fruit plate and guava empanada.  The guava empanada was heavenly...the filling was almost like a guava cream cheese.  Next, we tried the chilaquiles and the green corn tamale.  The green corn tamale is sweet and delicious with just a little sour cream.  We followed this with the Yucatan eggs benedict - not as delicious as all of my fellow Yelpers let on - and the steak and eggs.  My husband was a huge fan of the steak and eggs...I think he only shared one bite.  The breakfast enchilada and the chorizo and egg taco were last.  I am not a huge chorizo fan so I did not enjoy the taco, but the breakfast enchilada was amazing.  The chicken was so flavorful and tender and I loved the cotija cheese.  For dessert, we ordered the coconut french toast, which was a perfect ending to a fabulous meal...just the right amount of sweet.  

Our server was tremendous - very sweet and always there with a refill for my all-you-can-drink mimosas (only $5!).  The passionfruit one is incredible - I may have overindulged!

As requested, they gave us a table so we could see the Bellagio fountains.  Our reservation was at 9 PM and we were disappointed to find out that the chef was no longer offering the tasting menu that evening. Our waiter, however, said we could create our own tasting - excellent!  

We started with the polenta with mushrooms - delicious, but it maybe could have used a bit more salt. Next up was the infamous $24 spaghetti. Well worth it - this is the best pasta I ever ate. Since we were indulging, the next course was more pasta. The duck and foie gras ravioli. It was good, but very rich and not even close to as good as the beef cheek ravioli from Carnevino. I am not sure why people would compare the two. On carb overload we then had the lamb which was fantastic. For some reason they also sent out a duck entree which we had not ordered. Not a fan of the spices - cardamom and clove. Nor was I a fan of the waiter attempting to charge us for it. 
Dessert was the chocolate salted caramel cake. Good, but nothing to rave about. 

Wine prices are high but on par with everything else on the strip. 

Oh, I almost forgot the bread basket and dipping sauces. The Stromboli bread with salami and cheese is phenomenal. The marscapone butter could make even cheap white bread taste good.

They looked at a old water softener system that was no longer functional. After discussion, they suggested a new system that provides softening and filtration.  I did NOT feel pressured for purchase.  Instead, they gave me all the information and allowed me to make my own decision.  After giving the thumbs up, they were back in a couple of hours SAME DAY with the new system and got it all installed.  All questions I had about other repairs on the property (replacing outdoor piping, checking for leaks, etc) were answered without ego or frustration.

Another problem they found was I had a leak in my laundry room that had been present for quite some time.  It caused damage to the drywall and required repair.  They referred me to an excellent service and repaired the leak by installing new valves.

A couple days later, after moving in and getting my washer and dryer installed, I called AFTERHOURS and was surprised to get a callback almost immediately.  They came out next day to install the gas line for my dryer and check my gas fireplace quickly.

I happen to be in the store the day she came in trying to pick up her table on that Sunday. Her paperwork clearly said Monday and she had the wrong day. In fact I had to stop getting customer service so they could help her. She was yelling through the store and cussing at them using profanity I had my children in there. Total white trash is how she acted. I had to stay in the store until after they closed because of her stunt going over to the other store. She went to pick up her table at the 59th Ave. and Bell location she put it in her truck and she left and never paid for.  The owners daughter on the E. Bell Rd. location called her several times as I was sitting right in front of her. Rik never picked up her phone. I would say in the 15 minutes before she called the police she had to have called for probably 10 times. She knew she owed the money when she loaded the table she should have paid for it then. Howie world was left with nothing left but to call the police to protect themselves. I have never seen someone in my life be so rude to people in a store as this Riki was. Howie world was not rude to her or mean to her. She wanted them to deliver something on a different day and hour before closing. And it simply could not have been done. Riki Did not read her paperwork for the delivery date she messed up and she wanted them to take the blame for it And she drove the other location picked up the merchandise and didn't pay for.

Typically, there is not much on this planet that excites me more than fresh, local, organic ingredients on a sandwich, but when I can have that and a salad bar I am a happy little tree-hugger. 

Jason's is an all-time favorite sandwich place of mine and of my fellow vegan foodie. The portabello wrappini (hold the cheese, please) and the salad bar with their black currant tea are the keys to the good life for lunch and a mid-afternoon craving for a friggin' good sandwich. (And of course, the occasional slide on the vegan diet for a much needed fill of cheese that can only be satisfied by their french onion or tomato basil soup- yummo). 

A few bummers-  the lack of veggie sandwich options ( I think there are only 3 or 4), which is why I pretty much order the same thing every time. But having this in mind, I haven't been displeased going there for my mushroom wrappini. 

This is a good place to take anyone because they have stuff that everyone likes (even pasta for those who don't want a sandwich- in which case you should rush them to the nearest hospital because something ain't right- who goes to a damn deli and doesn't get a sandwich?). 

cheers and happy sandwiching, 
the vegan foodies

We began with the hot rocks appetizer. The steak was thin sliced and had a marinade that was full of flavor. You cook the steak to your liking and eat. Wonderful idea.. After the appetizer, I had the wedge salad. The presentation was beautiful and the flavors were consistent and well balanced. Yum. My husband had the caesar which he enjoyed.
We both had the Filet Mignon medium which was cooked to perfection. The side sauces were so good and really brought out flavors of the meat. We ordered the asparagus, the mac and cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes. My favorite was the mac and cheese... Seriously, I wish I had the recipe.. They were amazing!! The asparagus was not soggy which I find is the case alot of times. They had a fire roasted flavor which I enjoyed. The garlic mashed potatoes were great also.. some of the best I've had.

Right away our server brought out fresh, hot sliced bread with olive oil, garlic and balsamic... Wow! Great start to our meal.. I ordered the pasta with garlic and olive oil which included a salad with their house made ranch(which was creamy and delicious). My husband had the lasagna which came out piping hot.. still boiling in the pan.. I can definitely say that the lasagna was the best I've tasted.. the presentation being a plus. His dinner also included a salad which he upgraded to a caesar salad. To top our meal off, we had Chef Joel's signature bread pudding for dessert. WOW!!!!

I used to travel alot and Mcdonalds was always the ""go to"" fast food restaurant for us. Always consistant food and fast convenient service.

This branch is a very poorly run store. The last few times I have gone thru the drive thru the man taking the order was very rude. (the same person i think).. Could not seem to awnser any questions or be polite in any such way. And the food was sub par.

Two nights ago, we went to grab a quick snack wrap.. We were greated by a big man who had a very poor attitude. I thought maybe he was just having a bad night?? As we pulled to the counter to grab our order a car from the drive thru went around us to leave. He actually yelled at the man who takes orders that he needed to learn how to treat customers. I then knew that the rudeness that was suspected was not just my imagination.. 

Tonight was the absolute last time I will ever go here.. We went thru the drive thru around 12:00 AM and for some reason the man who normally takes the order said that they would be closed for 15 minutes for a break??? This is supposed to be a 24 hour location. I wasn't sure if he said 15 or 50 minute break so I asked him when they would re-open to have him yell 15 back in the headset?

I ordered a Noodle Soup and a Stir Fry. The noodle soup was so-so but the Stir Fry was a disappointment. This happened on Oct 25th afternoon - please refer to the attached picture of receipt. First, the chef thought it was just stir fry with no rice, and later on someone came over and put the rice back and gave the dish back to me with no apology. The Cashier was not interested in saying hello or trying to promote what's good in the restaurant. She didn't want to look at us in the eye - it's a bit rude honestly. Well, the owner smiled but that's the person who cared. 

Back to the Stir fry, take a look at what we got vs. what's up there on the menu board. The menu board stir fry looks a lot better - nice pieces of beef with broccoli and fresh veggie. Look at what I got! Lots of bean sprouts, which were not cooked very well. I was told it's the way they make it - it's Thai. Yes, it's true, but the bean sprouts reeks because it's not cooked well. Why? It's not fresh!!!!

Anyway, I was about to complain but when I checked out the Pad Thai another customer got across from my stable. It's merely two pieces of shrimp mixed with noodles. It didn't look too good either. I was like, well, I might as well save my breath. 

I mean, I have been a Thai Express fan since the day it was born. I like your Mini Soups and your Noodle Soups. Once in a while I visit your restaurants, but this time, it's the huge disappointment.

As an international renter, the idea of trying to find a place to live in a very hot real estate market was beyond daunting. I did some research online and time and again the advice I came across was to get a realtor. This then led to the next challenge: how would I choose my realtor? 

And to Yelp I went. Rebecca's name popped up near the top with great reviews stating how professional and involved she was (both very true). Upon visiting her website, I was instantly struck by how straightforward and open she seemed. Her bio is down-to-earth and includes details that make you feel comfortable and like you're about to get down to work with an old friend.

To me, she was the obvious first and only choice. I'm so glad I picked her! 

After sending her a detailed email of my situation and rental needs, she replied promptly and with positivity, reassuring me that while my situation was unique, it was hardly impossible. She set to work adding me to a database that would email me potential rentals that featured the specific things I was looking for. So awesome to be able to apartment hunt from your inbox! 

I did indeed find the perfect place, and I couldn't have done it without Rebecca. She made communicating with the landlords and their realtors a breeze and was able to prepare the lease and handle other details, freeing me to focus on other things associated with an international move.

Rebecca actually cares about her clients, and finding them the right rental or forever home is both her goal and her specialty. If you are looking to rent or buy, Rebecca should be your go-to choice.",0,XoiBk3HfY0F5WSBgDPZFog,0.4000000059604645

Because I'm strictly a film photographer, I was looking to find a store that would offer great support in terms of my analog needs. I tried one other place in the city and was disappointed by their crappy customer service and the fact that they kept their film stock hidden away from view. 

Not at Downtown Camera. With a wall made of vintage cameras and a range of films right out in the open, I knew this was going to be a good fit.

Not only do they have E6 outlab services, their turnaround time for film processed in-house is quick, and you can receive text or email updates to know when your film is ready. And they offer a punch card (for in-house developing only) to keep track of the film you've dropped off -
 once you've hit your ninth roll, your tenth is free! 

Seriously, if you are still shooting film, are only shooting film, or just getting into shooting film, this is your go-to lab and photo store! With so many places choosing to only cater to digital shooters and doing away with film processing altogether, we need to take care of the stores that are taking care of us! Make your film cameras happy, come into Downtown Camera! :)

*UPDATE*
As I've been taking more and more advantage of the film processing services at Downtown Camera, I've become aware of a few issues that I find problematic. Thus why I've felt the need to alter my original review. First, the customer service is very touch and go. Some days I go in, and it's fantastic. Other days, it's as if the person behind the counter is going through the motions. The assistance you receive is never consistent, and that's pretty much a bummer. Second, and even more disheartening, is the fact that next day film service at Downtown Camera is now three or even four days processing time, something that seemed to have started within the past month. I inquired about it possibly being due to a large influx of film to be processed, but the person behind the counter claimed that this was the norm. Not sure how next day can be advertised as such, but I do know that there are other film processing places in TO that will develop your film either that day or the very next day, dependent on how early in the morning you drop off, and that is their regular service. Just a few things to consider when assessing your film processing needs.",2,XoiBk3HfY0F5WSBgDPZFog,0.0

I looked online and saw that this store carried Blundstone boots. The official Blundstone site even listed this shop as having the boots I wanted - #584 - in stock. 

And then I went inside. The saleswoman wasn't what I'd call warm, but coming from NYC, I can be used to brusque salespeople. She informed me that they did not have my size in that particular boot in stock, but that I could check back in September. I then asked if I could try on another pair of Blundstones just to see how they feel on your feet since I've never owned a pair. The saleslady seemed put off. She told me that they wouldn't fit the same as the winter boots. I told her, I was aware of that, but if I was in the store, I'd still like to try a pair on to see if I even like the brand, especially if I was to wait until September for the ones I want. These boots aren't cheap either, so yeah, trying any pair on can give some insight into their fit.

She actually continued to dissuade me from trying them on. Someone whose very job revolves around getting people to buy shoes. It was confusing and she came off seeming like I was putting her out by asking her to pull a box of boots from the back. 

I repeated again that, if I'm going to spend that much money, I want to know what I'm getting into, and would like to know how any iteration of the boots fit. She finally acquiesced and went and got me the boots.

While all of this was going on, I felt awful. Unwelcome and unwanted. There was literally one other customer in the store with her mom. And me, being treated like I'm dumb for wanting to try on a pair of shoes.

I can say that many other stores in Toronto sell Blundstone boots and I would suggest if you would like to experience being treated with respect and decency, to avoid this store. Especially as a new arrival to this city, this kind of experience leaves me feeling flummoxed and bummed out. 

I should point out that I proceeded to pop into five or so other shops after going into this store, and every salesperson that greeted me did so with enthusiasm and kindness and provided exemplary customer service.

We all make choices with our wallets. I personally wouldn't spend my money or my time in this store in the future, as they made it very clear that I wasn't worth theirs.",2,XoiBk3HfY0F5WSBgDPZFog,-0.10000000149011612

I went in with questions about running clubs in the area and left with new shoes. The entire process couldn't have been easier. The woman helping me was genuinely kind, answered all my questions, and was quick to bring out any pair of shoes that she thought might work for me and my running style. She even helped me determine whether I've been pronating/supinating with their bio-mechanical analysis. She was thorough and friendly and it made my time in the store pleasant and super enjoyable.

If you're on the market for new running shoes, gear or just have questions about getting together with other runners, this should be your go-to spot.",0,XoiBk3HfY0F5WSBgDPZFog,0.6000000238418579

They will take such good care of you that I thought I was related to the owner of the company.
They kept telling me just get better and we will take care of everything else. Thier main concern was for me not to worry and leave everything to them. They took care of  insurance companies, doctors, medical bills, etc. This is a firm that doesn't advertise on tv or radio but I found by the grace of god. The whole staff is the best and will work hard for you and really care about you as a person. When I was told that they settled my case I finally cried.  They are amazing!!!.

They said it was incase I cancelled and that hotels do this all the time....um, I'm getting botox, not booking a room.  When I arrived, you have to sign in and state whether you're paying by card or cash which I thought was odd.  I met with the Nurse who was to do the treatment and she was nice enough.  She gave me the quote and I agreed.  Before she would even start, she said she had to have my credit card to take to the front desk to be run BEFORE treatment.  Seriously???!!!!!  I was treated like some deadbeat criminal!  I gave her my card, then had to wait while the front desk ran my card for the amount.  Obviously the charge went through without problem, but the experience left me disgusted with Suddenly Slimmer.

The basmati rice has a great flavor that went well with their curries.  With a range from somewhat spicy to very spicy, the flavor was delicious across the two curries and the soup/curry (whatever the third item in the lunch special was today).  The naan was average; I have had some better naan, but it served its purpose alongside the curries. The rice pudding (Kheer maybe?) was pretty good, but I'm not a big dessert person so I could take it or leave it, but it was nice after the spicy curries.

So, I am starving I just got home from working on the strip and I work at Bar too that closes at one in the morning that is why I called to ask. My husband and I walk inside and sit right in front of the bar at one of the high tops it was 15 mins before anyone came to greet us or give us any menus. Finally, a male bartender came and greeted us he was friendly but was in a rush to get our order he just handed us the menu and asked ""Do you know what you want?"" We needed a min and did not ask if we wanted some thing to drink or nothing just ""I assumed you been here before"". Retarded how can you say that to a guest. So, he came around sooner than I thought to take our order the way it was going we asked for it to go. I ordered the chicken dinner with rice and veggies; my man got a bucket of buffalo wings with extra buffalo on the side and an order of fried cheese. Then he asks do you want a drink while you wait we both said no it is okay.( In my head you'd probably bring it when the food is ready anyway.)  So it took 30 to 45 mins for the bar food to come out; we had paid before hand too and had to go up to the bar to ask the bartender how much longer that's when he finally got the food. I guess he noticed we gave him 20% and was extremely fast and nice I walked out My husband stayed to get some ranch to go. When we get home his wings were PLAIN we hand to melt butter and mix it with franks to toss the wings in to make them buffalo. Other than that the food was good the veggies did not seem fresh if anything they are frozen or canned.

C Thai Cuisine did not disappoint.

My first impressions of the restaurant were how clean it was inside and how kind and welcoming the owners were. They're in the first year of business and do all the work in there. But they take the time to talk to you and help you make your selections by suggesting menu items. There is a lot to choose from!

I started by ordering delicious summer rolls. This item is hard to mess up, and I admit that I've enjoy equally good rolls in other restaurants. My uncle had a won ton soup, his favourite. He's tasted enough won ton soup in his life to be able to confirm that it's delicious here.

I also had fried vegetarian dumplings, served with a delicious ginger-soy dipping sauce.

For my main course, I had roast duck with red curry, coconut milk, and basil leaves. I've never had duck at a restaurant before, and I was very please with my selection. My uncle had a pad Thai with shrimp and squid and he loved it.

The restaurant recently got its alcohol license, having a bring your own wine/beer policy. Icing on the cake.

If you like extraordinary Thai food and like to support hard-working entrepreneurs who actually serve a GREAT product, please go try C Thai Cuisine. You won't be disappointed.",3,BJ3VQ_8ysOmZS23JoppB4g,0.5

I've been an infrequent visitor for the past 10 years. I always wish I'd go more often.

The menu doesn't have too many options. But the choices you have are so flavourful that you won't feel lacking.

The plate sizes are quite large, though I have noticed that portions decreased a bit recently, and prices went up. Worry not, you'll still be stuffed and not spend too much.

Everyone should give Tehran a try. The food is delicious and the service is quick. And shame on someone rating a restaurant they've never been to and making a judgment based on hearsay.",2,BJ3VQ_8ysOmZS23JoppB4g,0.20000000298023224

They came recommended to us through our realtor when we were in escrow on our house.  The inspector recommended we have an air conditioning specialist evaluate the AC unit in our prospective house b/c it was not functioning within acceptable range when tested. 
Air-Force 1 claimed they inspected the unit, but very clearly, that was not the case. Post-inspection we REPEATEDLY tried to ascertain the inspection report they claim they completed, but they said 'it was lost due to moving [their] locations'. 
No more than 2 weeks after we closed escrow, the AC stopped working (In Arizona, in July!!) and we called our home warranty people to come and replace the unit.  They said it was very old and very damaged - so they denied our claim.

Remember that inspection report I said we were trying to obtain? Well, this is where it gets good.  They were never able to produce the original inspection document or the email they allegedly sent to my realtor stating that the unit had no issues. When we approached Air-Force 1 regarding the broken AC, they fabricated a duplicate report that 'back-peddled ' all the initial information they said about the AC unit being fine and stated that there were issues (mind you, only after speaking to us to find out what had gone wrong with the unit).

In the end, we got screwed for almost $4K on a new AC unit because apparently it was beneath Air-Force 1 do perform their job correctly or with integrity.

I will be sure to post my thoughts on this matter on 'pissed consumer' as well as to all 1,087 of my Facebook friends, not to mention the 12,000 people who follow me on Twitter.

She explained what might be a good alternative and I told her to go for it. She was conversational and made great conversation for the whole 3.5 hr appt. She ended up doing a full hi-lite with a toner and a cut. I absolutely LOVE how it turned out and have already received so many compliments on it.

You know, this resto club used to have great food, which came from the AIX kitchen, downstairs. Now AIX is gone, and the food, when it eventually comes, looks better than it tastes, UNLESS you like really rich food. Like really rich. As in a thick white truffle cappuccino and a butter-like fois gras. The combination of tastes on the plate is...odd. I can understand, for example, the theory behind mixing the fatty salmon tartar with acidic apple, but, well, it doesn't work. The fois gras plate was equally challenged. The worst was their Christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert, which was essentially a stale Twinkie...

On the bright side, the decor and service was very good (apart from the slow, slow kitchen). In fact, this is one of the only restaurants I've been to where the waitress waited for everyone to finish before clearing the plates - very unusual.",0,rC7r9GvfBm_hk3QA0_vJDQ,-0.10000000149011612

The food last night was decent, but I do think I could have made it at home with Jamie Oliver's Italian cook book. It's not too expensive, however, so long as you moderate your alcohol, which justifies going there. It can also be fun, with the nod to the retro decor and interesting hipster patrons an staff. Our hostess was great and the waitress not so good (didn't ask how things were until the meal was almost done, didn't ask me if I wanted another drink, etc.). 

The rustic style pizzas do remind me more of true Italian pizza than one would normally expect of a North American pizza joint. The name Magpie, after the bird, is a very commonwealth reference, which may seem odd at first.

The combination of vanilla, toffee brittle, and salted caramel was a great way to end my night. My daughter got the strawberry sherbet and the taste was bursting with strawberry flavor.

He ran credit on me and bam we were rolling. Gave me different payment options and scenarios all while staying honest and even standing his ground a little when negotiations came:). I like that about him. It was fair. I got what i wanted at the payment i wanted. Period. No hassel no hidden anything very professional.

(Keep in mind the car was a 05 with 190,000 miles on it. Cash price 5900). Another buyer came in and asked about the same car. Mikes partner told him no problem let me get u plates for a test drive.

When we asked why they could test drive and we couldnt mike and his partner screamed at us and said verbatim: I DONT WANT TO DEAL WITH COMPLAINTS IM CALLING THE POLICE GET OUT OF MY OFFICE..shocked we asked for our paperwork back of which he gave us another buyer's app and dl copy...we left.

First star is for the opening sequence. Just prior to the show the audience is treated to some acrobatic antics, and even a comedic reminder to stow the electronics. Paired with helpful staff in costume and character helping you to your seats, and a breathtaking stage to take in sets your heart pumping for a great show. The opening scenes don't disappoint. The martial arts in the first couple scenes are amazing to watch, and soon you are treated to a boat scene that is also fun to watch. 

Second star is for great acrobatics with the ""death wheel"" (you'll know it when you see it), and some more cool action sequences to close out the show. 

Third star is for the stage, which is a character all to itself. A massive monolithic stage that is on some sort of hydraulic mechanism that allows it to move, rotate, and lean in amazing angles further shows off the athleticism and skill of the actors as they use the stage to show a variety of talents. The stage can also be lowered completely out of site allowing for cool aerial acrobatics as well. 

Now for the last two stars that this show lacks. First off, you better listen carefully to the few lines of narration at the beginning of the show because that's all you'll get. While it does give the outline of the plot I still found it extremely difficult to follow the story line, and in fact there were several scenes that seemed ponderously slow and even repetitive without advancing the story in meaningful ways.  You never really understand why the enemy attacks, but they attack again and again, and normally in the same repetitive fashion. There are also two scenes, the beach and the shadow puppets, that are awkward and feel completely out of place. 

Second, with the exception of the first 10-15 mins and 5-10 mins towards the end, the show's acrobatics seemed to be just ""OK"". There were ""wows"" and ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" in each section there, but often there were only a few and sometimes featured too early in a scene and repeated then without the same wow factor. With such an impressive stage and hints in the pre show antics of ways to use the stage and even the space above the audience in amazing fashion, the show itself left me with the sense that there was so much more that could've been. 

All in all I was entertained but I can't say I enjoyed it, especially in comparison to other Cirque du Soleil shows and expectations. It's worth seeing for the stage if you can get a good price, but be prepared to feel like you over invested 90 mins of time. In another city and without the CDS mystique it would probably be amazing and awe inspiring, but in a Las Vegas world where ""Too Much"" is often ""Just enough"", I felt like Ka was just a little lacking.",3,PbccpC-I-8rxzF2bCDh8YA,0.10000000149011612

Christopher had several recommendation but when my wife and I were both interested in the Fish and Chips, he suggested that we order one with their dessert add on special and share. We agreed and added a mixed green salad. 

The salad was big enough for three and was very tasty. The fish and chips were delicious, the beer batter very flavorful and the fish itself was cooked to perfection. More than enough again for two of us and we still had dessert to go. 

The sticky toffee pudding to close things out was amazing. Probably the best dessert we have ever tasted and again more than enough for two people to share. 

This is Las Vegas and everything was pricey but for the value of the food and the experience and the absolutely amazing service from Christopher and Mehdi, this was probably the best money we have spent so far on our trip.

I was impressed with the servers knowledge and courtesy. It's hard to find great service and this is a four star service parlor. 

Two styles of crust. Thin or original. I would order original for take out because it holds up better. Thin crust is NYC style thin crust. 

This is not Papa Johns quality and the prices reflect the difference. Large cheese, large pep, sausage, onion and mushroom combined with a family size salad was 61.00. Not cheap but the quality is clearly different. 

Pizza was above Papa John's and below lombardi's. 

Salad dressing (house) was excellent.

Amongst the ten of us, we ordered some twelve dishes, including hakka chicken and shrimp, chicken 65, chili garlic noodles with chicken, garlic pepper chicken and shrimp chop suey.

The Chicken 65 was very good, with slightly tangy pieces of boneless chicken that had a crunch on first bite, garnished with red and green bell peppers. The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy. But the biggest disappointment was the hakka dishes, which are a signature Indo-Chinese noodle dish.  These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.

We wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants. We had to order a couple of extra entrees since some of us were still hungry, whereas we almost never can finish our food at other restaurants.

The service was competent bordering on perfunctory. One of us was curious about Nasi Goreng on the menu, but our server could not describe how it was prepared, instead steering us to a couple of other choices on the menu.

Our receipt invited us to share our experience at a ""Talk2us"" link, which only produced a ""survey error.""

Very relaxed atmosphere (jeans are great as goes for all of cave creek) w/ a few small TVs around over on the bar side at least (no sound heard, which I preferred). 

Mariachis (probably just because it was Valentines) were a nice touch for the occasion, ... bit louder then I prefer, but they were very good and had the tact to not come over to our table since we didn't make eye contact. Nice voices and instrumentation to be sure. 

Handi-capped friendly from what I remember. Private parking on the side was pleanty for a fairly busy Sat. night (w/ more out back). Light gravel made for no dust, and wasn't too thick so I'd guess wheel chairs wouldn't be a problem.

Around 12:00pm after I found that the St Lawrence market does not open on Mondays, I started to find a good place to have lunch on Old Toronto and I discover the The Corner Place. When we arrived, we could sit on any place because the place was not crowded.

The service was friendly and nice and the salad did not take so much time to arrive. But, at least, for me, when I arrive at place where the Wi-Fi is available I like to have access. I tried all the variations provided by the waitress and none worked. On the end, she asked me to look for one of the customers and ask him how they connect. Very bad negative point for me.
Overall, the salad was okay. To be true, I prefer the Asian Chicken Sesame salad from Panera Bread. The dried noodle was very hard to eat and most of the salad components were cut in chunks instead of niece pieces to eat with a fork. What makes a mess while you are eating. Well... I did not get excited with the food this time.

This is a past experience review. On Thanksgiving Day around 8:30PM, we did not have so much effort to find a place to leave our car there. The hostess was very friendly and nice and directed us to our table without any need for waiting. Obviously the restaurant was almost empty due to the holiday.
The dining room was huge and there is a sundae bar that we got very tempted to eat there after the dinner. The waitress was very nice and friendly and was always checking our table to see if we needed something more. Because we were craving for a burger, my wife and I decided to build our own burger.

One big point for this restaurant was that we did not need to wait so much for our food to be ready. Something that happens a lot of times with the so called ""fast-food"" restaurants.

On Thursday around 7:00pm, me and my wife went to the restaurant to have our dinner and we faced the first negative point, the parking lot. The parking lot was not enough to accommodate all the people to the restaurant because it is shared with other stores around. So, it was not hard, but it was easy to notice there was not enough space for everyone. At least, we did not need to wait so much time to sit.

The table was clean, but there was an old newspaper below my table and I noticed that the floor was not totally clean. On a first moment, I thought that the waitress service was nice, but after we placed the order, we got forgotten. My soda glass was empty for a long time and the waitress never comes back asking if I wanted more. But the rolls were delicious, unfortunately, what I cannot say about the Frango no Churrasco and the Bacalhau that me and my wife asked.

Overall, it was frustrating for asking the two items that were house specialties and eat a food with poor quality. The Bacalhau was under seasoned and burned plus the potatoes were blend too. My Frango no Churrasco, the chicken was almost very good, the rice and potatoes were almost cold. It seems that the food was released for a time and they forgot there. But the worst for me was having a bad Bacalhau on a Portuguese restaurant. It is a very bad sign. I don't plan to come back again to it and if you are looking for a Portuguese restaurant, I recommend looking for other.

After a long drive to Toronto, ON. We saw this small place and beautiful very near of our hotel. It was around 7:10pm when we arrived and the place was empty. Maybe because it is Sunday night. But is an injustice, places like this deserves to be always crowded.

The service was very friendly and nice and the salads and soups did not take so much time to arrive.  Almost all the sits you can admire the park, because the restaurant windows are very huge.  My wife asked for a lentils soup and Cesar salad, I just asked for the Cesar salad.

On Wednesday around 12pm, I went to the restaurant to get my food to go and have my lunch on another place. The place was crowded, but I noticed some free seats there. The cashier line was not so big and I did not take so much time to place my order.

After paid, I direct myself to the food delivery station and noticed something that I never noticed on the other restaurants on the USA side. They have a monitor that counts how much time each food is taking to be ready to go and the order changes color when it takes so much time. Nice thing. It incentives the staff to have always a better performance.

Overall, the chocolate chip cookie was delicious like always, but I did not like so much the salad. Different than on USA, I found big chunks of lettuces instead of in small pieces like the other restaurants. This is a negative point to me, because I expect always a good preparation for this food due to the complexity of it.

After paid, there is a place that you can sit to wait for your food to be ready. I waited more or less 15/20 minutes for everything to be done. While I was waiting, I was using the free Wi-Fi to check my e-mails and read the news.

Overall, the fries were dry but tasteful. They were not greased or unseasoned and the burger at a first sight seemed dry what is a bad sign most of the times.

On a Good Friday, around 9:00 PM, the restaurant was almost full. But when we arrived there the hostess did not offer a place to us to sit at a first moment, we need to look for her and ask to sit on a table. But even with this, I liked the restaurant.
The waiter service was a little slower than most of the other restaurants but he was a very nice and friendly person. He was always aware when my soda needed refill. The place seems a night point for the young people on the city and the music was played for a DJ and after for a band. What I can say, it was cool! I almost stand and went there to dance. This time, my wife and I asked for a The Original Burger and the Roast  1/2 Chicken. Both food presentations were very good and in a ""young"" way.
Overall, it was a very nice experience. There was no dried part of the chicken and the chicken gravy was to dying for. And oh my God, the food was very exciting. Something to change? Nothing.

On a Good Friday around 2:00 PM, the restaurant was almost empty probably because the city was empty too. Said that, we could select any place to sit and wait for our food. The place is very clean and the menu was not fancy enough and offers any kind of food for different levels of taste.
The waitress was a very nice and friendly person. She was always aware when my soda needs refill. The place is very clean and calm. It is a very nice place to have a business dinner or just a quiet place to eat. This time, my wife and I decided to eat a Cesar Salad with Chicken and a Malaysian Chicken Curry. Where both food presentations makes me wanting to eat them with the eyes.
Overall, it was a very nice experience. I never thought that a coconut flavored food could be so good. Just as a personal touch, the only thing that I could change is cutting the chicken in pieces instead of having the whole chicken breast there. But, is how I said, it is only a personal touch.

On Saturday around 4:00PM, the restaurant was not so full and we did not need to wait to sit. The mansion is impressive and they make a very good use of it. But this is not a place for people that has problem with stairs, because the restrooms are located on the 2nd floor.
The waitress was very nice and friendly. She was always aware when she needs to refill my soda glass. The rolls were fresh and hot, something rare to find on a restaurant. The place is good for big groups and quiet enough for a calm lunch or dinner. This time we decided to try the Chicken Oscar and the Rib Steak.

Good for big groups: No

On Saturday around 2:00PM, the store was not so full. One of the negative points was not offering more places to sit there and enjoy the gelatos or sorbets. But my wife and I found two seats for us to sit together.
I can't deny. The ice cream was very good. I had he roasted almond gelato and I'm still thinking on it, even many hours after eating it. But the service was something frustrating because when I asked if they had another flavors, the woman told me that they had more at the other store, something that I found on the same day that was wrong, because the other store was only going to start serving gelatos or sorbets until next week.
Overall, the gelato was very good but the service was very bad. The worst part beyond going to the other store and not finding what I want, was asking for where it was the subway on the Spadina Avenue and the guy told me that was very near to go walking what was wrong and I made my pregnant wife walking a lot without a need for that. Next time, I would ask if you do not know, do not give wrong information to the people.

Is the private parking lot enough to accommodate all the guests? No

On April 2012, I reserved a room for 2 nights because I had some appointments to attend on Toronto. The room that I got was small but not bad. Even not having some good options to eat near around, the localization of it stills good. Because I the only time that I needed to use my car again, was only to leave the hotel. It was very accessible to get the public transportation from there to anywhere that I wanted to go.

The front desk service was friendly and nice and the breakfast offered much more options to eat that I am used to have from other hotels that I stayed on Toronto. Unfortunately, when we said to the housekeeper that we don't want our room cleaned she started to question us when we were planning to leave and that we need to notify the front desk for that. (Note: we were on the middle of our 2 nights stay) This point upset me a little.

Overall, with the exclusion of the housekeeper moment, I liked so much the hotel and I am planning to stay there again next time I visit Toronto. And if you are planning to go there too, my recommendation to you is: leave all the luggage on the hotel lobby. Because if you try to use the corridor that connects the garage to the hotel it is not an easy thing to do because the doors are heavy and maybe you need to go back to the garage sometimes to get everything.",1,95KCaXFJEGla4AK7ETBmWw,0.10000000149011612

This is a past experience review. Around 7:30PM, the restaurant was not crowded and there were still available many sits there. The hostess was very friendly and nice and directed us to the table without any waiting time. The parking lot is shared with the other stores of the mall, but because it was night and most of the commerce around was closed, so we can say that was a ""private"" parking lot.
The dining room was an excite place, really remembering a churrascaria on Rio de Janeiro. It made me feel home sick (what is good). The waitress was very nice and friendly and was always checking our table to see if we needed something more. Because this is a Brazilian barbeque place, my wife and I went there looking to eat a rodizio.
Overall, the experience was fantastic! Because they know how to cut the meat on a Brazilian style and they offer Brazilian goodies to consume there too like Guarana or Brazilian coffee. After the dinner, I talked with the owners and found that they are Brazilians. So, if you are really looking for a place to have a real Brazilian barbeque experience around Pittsburgh, PA, this is the place.

Store is pretty good if you can find what you want without help. Almost have to beg someone to help at the counter. Told one salesman the gun I wanted to look at and he immediately goes into how I should get quality since my life may depend on it.

Told the salesman I just want a gun to shoot paper and something my wife can shoot. Not carrying, concealed or going to a war zone. Just want to buy a first gun to see if me and my wife like it and want to do more. 

Have to get quality and something dependable, ME: So your store sells undependable crap? They don't, but I should get the expensive one. (paraphrasing).

Transferred from an online store something they don't even have in stock, never carry and never will. Went there during lunch and a different salesman acted like he didn't really didn't want to do a transfer, it showed and he made it clear.

He knew when to stop by and when not to. He knew what to recommend and to describe how everything was prepared. I will never forget asking him what the special of the night was and how well he described it that I had to ordered it. Beef Wellington. Unfortunately, they had run out of it. So he recommended I got the filet mignon, as this is what the restaurant is well known for. I do not regret listening to him. The steak was cooked perfectly. Medium never tasted so good. My brother had the filet mignon as well but his was with mashed potatoes and mine with fries. I ended up leaving him without mashed potatoes because they were too good for me not to eat them off his plate. They were creamy, fluffy and soft at the same time.

I fell in love with this place. The food. The service. The ambiance. Even the location was perfect. 
It's away from the Vegas strip which can be a bit too loud for one to enjoy a nice meal but at the same time its so close to Fremont St that has a lot to offer. The restaurant is located exactly across from the back of the Container Park, which by the way everyone should go to. 

The wait time here is tricky, it depends at what time you show up. But don't be taken back by the amount of people waiting, every second you wait will be worth it once you go in and eat. 

The menu is very basic, but everything sounds great and if you are like me you will find yourself looking at other table sot see what people ordered. So everywhere I turned everything looked amazingly good. For appetizer, we had some biscuits with strawberry sauce drizzled with confectionery sugar....TO DIE FOR. As soon as we took a bite of the biscuit we knew that we were in for a good eat. 
For main course i went for the pancakes with an apple sausage and my brother and mom went for the breaded steak, yes STEAK. When they ordered they missed the part that said steak so when they went in for the cut they say that it was not a fried chicken breast, it was steak. And holy moly was that a big piece of steak. Both of them could of ate from one plate. The steak came with two eggs and potatoes. As to my pancakes, it was a simple dish, but boy were those pancakes huge.

What a TERRIBLE experience.  One of the boys that worked there sold me the wrong part - after a while, a pool guy sent me back to get the right part. I went back and was told the boy doesn't work there anymore and ""what's in the past is in the past"". 
Unbelievable. 
So, they slapped some old parts on my Hayward pool vac that the guy got out of his garage.  (I kid you not) And to rub salt in the wound, I had to pay $60 for more replacement parts.  As I was paying I asked ""so no apology? - no discount?"".  The guy said nope.
So, those of you living in Morrison Ranch - you have been warned!

At first when you walk in, you do notice the equipment is outdated.  But the main trainer is one of the best I've experienced.  I felt it was ideal for beginners and those who have experience training.  

Every boot camp class was different and I attended 3 a week. Different music was played each class, so it was never the same.  Each boot camp class had different exercises so I was never bored.  We worked on every aspect of exercise, core, cardio, weight training, stretching, etc.  The teacher did go back and forth from English and Spanish which I thought was considerate since both Spanish and English speaking people were attending the class.  

One of the things I noticed was since I had bought a groupon, the trainers at the gyms I attended are notified you're a groupon buyer, almost like a label, and didn't show as much attention to me as they did to others.  As a groupon buyer you're not paying full price so it can show from the place you're at they won't give you full service.  At this gym this wasn't the case.  On two different occasions I was the only one who showed up for the boot camp class and instead of him cancelling he provided 1 on 1 personal training.  He was basically working for free but trained me like a full paying customer.  

Bottom line he's an excellent trainer who knows his stuff and cares about everyone that walks in the door.  The gym may not be the biggest or the newest but that's nothing in comparison to receiving quality training.  And that's what you'll get at GAP fitness.",0,3V-iHN_dQXTnwJjYB41Jcg,0.10000000149011612

- It's a great gym with the best equipment I've come across.  That said I enjoy speed & power training.  So the track and plethora of strength equipment are fantastic.  I really enjoy the hammer strength brand machines, they are just the most solid machines out there with the best ranges of motions.  The free weights are amazing & rarely am I waiting on weights.  The one thing lacking: kickboxing bags.

-Swimming pools, hottubs, and a yoga room - with free classes are also here.  I rarely use them, so somebody else should review these.  

-It can be busy, but people are quite accommodating and will share equipment; make some friends ppl :) 

-The staff will teach you basically anything for free & there is some serious experience kicking around.  Some not so experienced too, so just be choosy, as always.

-I'm only giving it 4 stars because it is a huge facility and lacks a certain social or community atmosphere.  It is what you make it, but the size of the facility can be a bit daunting at times.  That said, for coming in and getting your workout done, it can't be beat.

     Another thing they have is a Sunday brunch all you can eat sushi offering. This is unusual in Arizona and love that they do it.

It was an exceptional cheesecake but also a little different than the usual cheesecake.  Guessing there is Greek yogurt in there but not sure.  Anyways, delicious!

It delivers the WOW!-factor with all the Cirque-type amazing aqua-acrobatics, and keeps you entertained the whole way through. Seriously, the performers were doing twists & turns & jumps & moves I didn't even know  was humanly possible. The diving segment was my favorite. Hats off to all the amazing performers!! 

A little tip about the seating..... The venue is an intimate circular theater, with the circular pool in the center as it's stage. There are only 12 rows of seating, so yes, basically every seat has a great view & you really can't go wrong. The first 2 rows are considered ""splash zone"" ($105/seat), the next 9 rows (Rows 3-11) are Premium seats ($129/seat) and the last row (Row 12) is the VIP/Dream seats (ranging from $155 to $195/seat.).  I have sat in the 1st row (splash) and 5th row (premium) and can honestly say I much preferred the premium row. I'm not discouraging the splash zone seats because of the threat of getting wet.... In fact, I only got a sprinkle of water while in the first row (if even that)! The reason I suggest the premium section is because this show has SO much to see and by sitting a bit further back, you'll be able to take in more visually.  There is also a lot of the acts happening high up (way high up, from the ceiling).... and I found myself straining my neck to see all that was going on up high, whereas you could view it all at ease sans the neck strain if you were in premium:)  Also, I don't think it's worth it to get the VIP/Dream seats.... other than it offering a super plushy comfy chair (and champagne & choco covered strawberries) , one of the perks to those seats is that it includes a video monitor in front the seat, which I heard is streaming you live feed of all the backstage and underwater action during the show, but believe me, you'll have so much to watch on stage, I don't think you want to waste your time watching the monitor ;)",12,1oCH03guW5bqwvLrCEuVwQ,0.4000000059604645

It's moving. It's captivating. You will leave the show with a huge smile on your face, a hop & skip in your step, and you will NOT be able to stop humming all the fabulous songs in your head for days!

- Walk Like a Man

Quick tidbit on seating:
JB has been at ""Paris Theater"" since March 2012. It's a bigger stage & venue than when it was at Palazzo (where it reigned from 2008 thru 2011). Other than size, another difference is that this new theater does not have a balcony. You are either in the front half (Orchestra section), or back half (Mezzanine). When I got my tix, I was told that the last row (Row M) was only 75 feet away from the stage, implying that even the last row has a good view of the stage. I ended up getting seats in Row K (third row from the back), and they were right! You still have a great view of everything. :)

I've seen JB twice, and can't wait to see it again!!!!!",7,1oCH03guW5bqwvLrCEuVwQ,0.4000000059604645

First, a few fun facts:
- The official ribbon-cutting was on February 2, 2013 
- Of the 29 NOBU restaurants, this is the largest location worldwide! 
- The NOBU Hotel, a ""boutique hotel"" which is next to the restaurant (both in Caeser's) is the first ""NOBU Hotel"" ever! It has 181 rooms, and even features a number of suites with up to 5 rooms. One of these days, I WILL stay here.... the pics of the rooms are gorgeous...and get this, 24-hour availability to Nobu in-room dining room service. Eeeep! ;)  

Now, back to the restaurant. You are greeted with an elegant entryway filled with origami birds overhead. Just past the check-in desk, you get a full glance of the beautiful modern & trendy main dining room filled with artistic lamps that look like floating jellyfish. There is a bar and lounge in the front area, sushi bar on the left side, and then the sea of seats filling the rest of the open & spacious layout. There are a variety of different style of seats to accommodate all different sizes of parties..... small tables for the romantic couples, larger booth tables (both circular and square), and secluded tables (in nest-like booth areas) for more private larger parties. There are also secluded areas for the teppanyaki grill tables. Overall, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, which sets the tone for the amazing food you are about to indulge in.

Now, onto the FOOD! Below are the dishes (mostly signature favorites) that me and the hubby had.... Each one was fabulous, and extremely satisfying....!!

1) Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - $28   (a MUST HAVE!)
six (heavenly!) thinly sliced pieces of yellowtail, with an even more thinly sliced piece of jalapeno on each. In a light ponzu sauce, and coupled with a piece of cilantro, this combo melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. This is my FAVORITE dish. I bet 99% of the people who get this are thinking ""should I order another round now or later?"" as they are finishing off this one ;) 

2) Black Cod w/ Miso - $34 (a MUST HAVE!)
So succulent & tender....every bite of it literally melts in your mouth! Don't ""pass"" on this one, thinking once you've had a good black cod, you've had em all. NOPE! This one is amazing & you should believe all the hype about it!! The sauce is light & sweet, and I just have a STRONG feeling you will not be disappointed :) 

3) Kumamoto Oysters with Nobu Sauce - $18 (a MUST HAVE!)
This comes with 3 oysters, each topped with a different garnishing (maui onion, ""las vegas"", and jalapeno). If you have a party of 2, I strongly suggest you get 2 orders so that each person can have their ""own"" trio :) It was super fresh n delicious! 

4) Rock Shrimp Tempura - $24 (a MUST HAVE!)
OK, so per our server, this signature dish usually comes with either the Creamy Spicy or Butter Ponzu sauce.....but Exec Chef Thomas Buckley (who was brought over from the Miami Beach location) decided to throw in a 3rd sauce choice... Jalapeno! We couldn't decide between the butter ponzu & Jalapeno, so our server offered to bring it out not tossed, but with the 2 sauces 'on the side'. I suggest you do this, as both sauces were amazing and I think you can savor the flavors more with dipping rather than having it mixed in. Served on a bed of micro greens which also tasted good with the sauces. 

5) Spicy Miso Chips with Big Eye Tuna - $16
This was tasty but I felt that the plum sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowering. Would have loved this if the sauce was more subtle... 

6) Pork Belly Miso Skewer - $14
If you love pork fat, this is your dish! Comes with 2 skewers of incredibly butter-like pork cubes. Tasty, but again I thought there was a lil too much sauce.  My hubby thought it was delicious though!

Dessert
We went with one of the most popular picks -- The Bento Box - $15
Flourless chocolate cake, with white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup, and house-made green tea ice cream. Delicious and the perfect way to wrap up a wonderful dinner experience. 

I'm already thinking about when I can go back again. Maybe Nobu will consider his next venue in the Bay Area? SF and San Jose would love one!!!!! :oD !!",20,1oCH03guW5bqwvLrCEuVwQ,0.5

Initially, I didn't even want to go here..... because my first impression was that it was going to be tiny servings with a fancy bow & big $$$ tag, that would leave me still hungry for more. Boy, was I wrong! Every dish ordered was prepared and cooked to perfection. Bursts of flavor, fabulous presentation, reasonable portions, and just overall a wonderful experience for the tastebuds. Love the decor & ambiance too. 

Below are a few comments on the dishes I will be crawling back for :) And please note: I did not try all of the below in one sitting. The list includes dishes tried on 3 different sittings :) 

MUST HAVES! 
- Tuna Cones - this was my favorite dish! I wanted another order! But btw, i think it's only available at dinner. I didn't see it available on their lunch menu :( 
- Stuffed Piquillo Peppers - so delish! especially if you like goat cheese & mushrooms. Was my second favorite dish! 
- Ahi Tuna Tempura - maybe because I love both Ahi Tuna & Tempura, but I thought this was just scrumptious
- Tuna Raspberry Skewers - a nice twist of flavors. 
- White Ceviche - this ceviche was divine! My only complaint was it was a bit heavy on the lime, but then again I'm just not a lime fan ;) 
- Spanish Chicken Croquetas - kinda like fried mozzarella stick, but with chicken & creamy bechamel sauce! I really liked this. Note: I luv creamy/cheesy stuff.  
- Grilled Lamp Chops - very tasty & tender

GOOD!, but nothing to scream about: 
- Wild Mushroom Soup - again, it was really GOOD! but I would prefer getting a second order of something above if given a choice :) 
- Lobster Salad 
- Lobster Saffron
- Beef & Cheese
- Padron Peppers - i felt like it was a bit too salty (this coming from someone who LOVES salt!) Also, it's probably more ideal as a sampler dish for a large party. For my table of 2, I felt like I had enough after a few bites, and felt padron pepper'd out by the time we finished the plate :op
- Brava Potatoes - don't get me wrong, it was delicious. but as it's a pretty filling dish, i just felt that these were not out of this world, and I'd rather fill up on one of the many other tapas choices they have to offer

Overall, it was so delicious. Can't wait to head back here soon!! :oD",5,1oCH03guW5bqwvLrCEuVwQ,0.4000000059604645

I get that I am supposed to tip on the full amount - I can do the math - the 'non-negotiable' automatic 15% tip on the total INCLUDING tax is ludicrous.  Given this was not disclosed in advance or on the Groupon, it's also not legal.  A gratuity is a gratuity, and I would have given my host Nasir a larger tip given the option to set my own bar.  Smart businesses know that customers are marketing vectors and correspondingly treat them well, even if they are there on a deal.  Unfortunately, O.Noir is pleased to rely on its position as a novelty experience rather than stand behind its food and service standards to drive more customers through the door.  Their prerogative I suppose, but it can't be good for repeat business.

I was also charged a random $15 dollar charge 'for using a Groupon' which was not stipulated anywhere on the deal.  This is truly what made me feel cheated and left a sour taste in my mouth.  My bill was identical to what it would have been without the deal = lame.  The wait to pay for said bill post-meal was crazy - they could use a more streamlined payment system (two operational tills would be nice).

The food itself was hit or miss - drink prices weren't outlandish, though considering you're apt to knock one over, this is a good thing.  I had the steak, which was great - my girlfriend had the shrimp/risotto, which was way oversalted and overdone to the point you could patch drywall with it.  The atmosphere is what you are here for, but even blind you can feel banquet style chairs and inordinately tight spacing with other couples/groups.  Your other senses heighten and you end up hearing a lot of other peoples' conversations very audibly, and I happened to be seated next to the most vapid and inanely redundant human beings in existence, rendering the experience even more unpleasant.  Guests in our room almost got in a blind fistfight over somebody using an indiglo watch for a second, which was entertaining in a Jerry Springerish sense.  

That second star is for the host Nasir - he's a righteous dude.  Too bad given my experience it's unlikely myself or anyone I recommend restaurants to won't get to experience his charm.",1,fsUMORfhG2rwE7rX8uYmmQ,-0.20000000298023224

The birthday singing thing is kitsch, and pretty annoying because it happens so frequently (6 times my last visit), but the food at Pantheon is really good.  I have been twice and have not been disappointed.  The dips combo plate is amazing, though I would ask to switch out the Taramosalata if you don't like caviar, which is too fishy for my taste.  Their pita is fantastic, and their seafood is out of this world.  Saganaki amazing, horiatiki is not the best on the strip, but passable.  3 people ate and had an alcoholic bev for $90, and had leftovers for another meal.

The portions were awesome, and the value to quality ratio was off the charts.  Clean stylish restaurant, and some really righteous patrons.  I'm talking almost once a week visits, sinking almost $500 into this place over three years.

...unfortunately there are new owners or something is going on as my last few visits I've observed a discernible downtrend in the portion sizes, and the prices have all been upped.  No longer can I get my 3 pc biftekia and chicken gyro with zucchini fries for $14 - it now comes out to over $20.  That's insane inflation for a standard pricehike and coupled with smaller portions does not make me a happy customer.  I had recruited a small army of people to repeatedly go here for Greek but will now need to find a new place that values the customer experience in true Greek fashion.

When they were a street operation, albeit a semi-legal one, it was really cool, novel - people would line up for days.  The tacos were $3 apiece, and it was a unique and fun experience. 

Ever since they got fixed locations though, I am very unimpressed.  I have slight hearing loss and the environment in this place is not conducive to any form of conversation - the music is all rap and hip hop and seriously and intensely loud.  I don't mind the style of music at all and am happy to eat tacos to A Tribe Called Quest, but at airplane-taking-off decibel levels? I was with a group and couldn't hear a word of what was being said, made me feel stupid and isolated.  Asking for music to be turned down was disregarded - 'this is our brand' was what I got in return.  Gross.  Service was slow and weirdly pretentious given the aesthetic they are trying to cultivate.

As per the tacos - overpriced and way small.  No lies, the cod fish is a decent two bites, but the carnita, cotija and beef cheek taste very boring - like more boring than ground beef with a 99 cent taco mix packet boring.  You could eat ten of them easily and still be hungry, which sets you back over $60 - the price/food ratio is rough and both times I left hungry, poorer, and disappointed.

The cherry on top is that this place is run by misogynists who think it is funny to make taco puns at the expense of women.  They have done this multiple times, and I am certain will continue to do so despite overtures to the public.  But hey, it's just locker room talk, right? 

On food quality, ambiance, and price, there are many, many better options for tacos in Toronto - I would skip this one.",7,fsUMORfhG2rwE7rX8uYmmQ,-0.20000000298023224

I only went the one time so I'm not telling you you need to get those things, but you certainly won't be disappointed if you do.

Ambiance was okay - a predilection to play music a tad too loud like many restos catering to the young professional sensibility, which I don't get, but it seems the trendy thing to do.  Attracts annoying overpaid hipster patrons as well - the table next to us was a clamorous sea of forgettable vapid single women in their 30s that would repeatedly rupture into a crescendo of squeals: ""this song is about me!"" or ""I know the chef, ladies I know the chef - WHY ISN'T ANYBODY LISTENING TO ME?"" or ""Tamara is a super betch"" or new girl sits down at table, prompting sounds that could etch glass, despite it being said Tamara.  Etcetera.  If it wasn't for our neighbours, the entire experience would have been ethereally sublime.

We had the table closest to the door, it was winter, and it was crazy cold sitting there.  Don't sit there.

  I ordered a cocktail, the club soda was flat. I also ordered the Cobb salad. Errrrr, it's hard to mess up a cobb salad. I was excited to see ""5 minute egg"" as one of the ingredients as I love a beautiful yolk, but it came out on a square of iceberg lettuce. This is only okay if you've ordered a wedge salad and they disguise this cheap lettuce by drenching it in blue cheese. I cut into the egg... lovely. So, why is my salad sort of watery? Like maybe they rinsed the lettuce and didn't spin it? The whole thing has a slimy feel.  Plus an excessive amounts of pickled onions, which I'm a fan of generally. I'm about to order something else cause I can't choke this down....wish me luck. 
  Ordered the tartare. Interesting and pretty good. Pickled mushrooms and mushrooms crisps on top (yum) but half way through,  there was so much mustard, I got queesy.

First the good: 616 W Baseline

I have been a loyal repeat customer of Cobblestone Auto Spa ever since I encountered Jared, one of the managers at the 616 W Baseline. 

The first time I went there I had my car detailed for $150 after discounts. The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.

I am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.

COBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!

Now the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex

I first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.

I then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.

I then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.

When I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.

Finally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.

I went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.

The next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. 

I knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.

I suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.

As a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.

I went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. 

They reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.

Jared to the rescue:

I took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.

I had been emailing Tom at Friendly Computers and told him exactly what was wrong with my hard drive and what Geek Squad and other techs had told me (that it would have to go to a clean room in order to recover my data).  Being desperate because all of my 2 year old's baby pictures and videos are on that hard drive, Tom gave me hope (false hope) so I took it in to him.  He told me he was 60-70% confident that he would be able to retrieve my data.  I had to pay $169 flat rate fee and leave the hard drive with them possibly for a couple of week.  About 5 days later he calls me and he tells me that he can't get any of my data.   He offers to send it to their clean room lab for an evaluation but the $169 that I already paid them was not gonna be refunded to me.  I told him I paid $169 for nothing and he said well it wasn't for nothing because we've been working on it and trying.  This sounds to be like a great way to scam people.  Tell them you think you can help them and get them to pay the $169 all the while knowing that you can't get any of that data but you sure got their money.  Wonder how many others are out there that have been thru the same situation.  Also, I have read this sales agreement/receipt 3 times and don't see where it says the fee is non refundable even if they can't retrieve your data.  Maybe I'm overlooking it but I don't see it.  DO NOT GO TO FRIENDLY COMPUTERS.  They are not ""friendly"".  They are major con artists, scammers, liars, etc.  Don't waste your time or money and don't get your hopes up.  I got my hard drive back from him minus my $169 that was wasted down the drain and he probably erased all my data so that no one else would be able to recover it since I refused to let him send it to his lab.

That was not the case here.  I would say that our room was a step up from the Motel 6 down the street. 

We were placed in one of the Bungalow rooms, which is essentially, the older section of rooms.  It has three floors with one side facing the pool and the other facing a loading dock and the Tropicana roof.  If you are lucking enough like us on our anniversary, there will also be a roof access door that is cracked open about 20 feet from your window so any Tropicana employees that happen to walk through that door will have a clear view into the room.  No luck in switching rooms either.

The carpet, furniture, and mustard yellow wall paper made it feel dated, along with the cracks in the ceiling.  The only updates in the room that I could tell was a 42-inch flatscreen TV and the shower.  

The lobby looks nice and updated, but the casino itself is pretty small.  We ended up spending most our time elsewhere.  Pool look decent, but was crowded.  Half of the area was empty as it was reserved for 'special' guests.  

If I were to do it all over again, I would have saved the extra cash spent on this supposed 4-star hotel and booked at one of the other 3 star casinos nearby that have better rooms, bigger casinos, and better location.",0,USqqFNBXaUxFhsaKhmuEkw,0.0

I even dropped by few times to make sure what I saw during our tour was what you'd actually get.  The site is very well maintained and extremely clean.  

The meals and snacks are carefully planned by a nutritionists who incorporate diverse menu (fish, tofu, various ethnic menus like pad thai) that incorporates seasonal veggies and fruits.  

I cannot say enough about the staff though - they truly love what they do and it shows.  From the day we started transitioning my little one at 12 months, all the teachers have shown nothing but love and care.  They make sure each child is engaged and cared for and I am always grateful for all the work that they do with the children.  

The webcam access to the room is also a bonus (it came really handy during the first few weeks when it was just as much of a transition period for me as it was for my child - I may have spent a good chunk of my day watching/weeping/laughing).

Another added bonus is how responsive the head-office is to suggestions.  Parents are encouraged to give feedback and suggestions and they are very responsive to parents' inputs.  The weekly newsletter also allows us to know what my little one has been learning so that we can reinforce some of the things at home (ex. songs or books that they have been learning).

If you have been to The Black Hoof, the menu will look extremely familiar -- don't get me wrong, the food is tasty and good (ex. tongue with broche, horse tartar) but there really isn't much new if you have been to his other restaurants.

The bartender took forever to get my drink made -- he kept looking back to the menu to figure out the ingredients were.  Also, I'm not sure if we just had a new waitress or just not the friendly ones other reviewers have said but our waitress told different tables different list of the night's special.  For example, when we asked about what fish they were using for the ceviche, she told us that they were only serving sea bream -- then told the other table that they had the option between sea bream or red snapper.  

For every table she went to, she'd ask if they wanted to order anything else, then if the customers said 'no', she'd roll her eyes as she walked away.  Other wait staff re-filled our water, never her.  Our plates were also taken away before we finished our food.

My initial impression was great because they seemed to be so kind and caring towards our kiddos.  However, from a business perspective they are terrible.  They are very difficult to get a hold of, whether if it's to make an appointment or ask a question.  We had an appointment and when I called earlier in the week to confirm the time, I did not get a response.  The morning of the appointment I reached out again to ask how much time they'd need for our dogs because we had a potential conflict and had to leave the house 3 hours out from what I was guessing was our scheduled time.  I thought maybe we could do 2 of 3 dogs, but wasn't sure if we could get all 3 done.   When I did get a response back, it was a text saying they were cancelling our appointment entirely.  No call to answer my initial question of how long they'd need or a discussion to figure out an alternative solution (I could have easily had my mother come to the house).  Then Mitch went on to say that they might not be the best service for us because they prefer customers that have recurring appointments and they were raising prices.  A...they never discussed a desire to have recurring appointments, which we'd be happy to do if we were aware it's a requirement and B...there had been no discussion about a change in pricing.  Instead they cancelled on us within hours of our appointment and implied I was lucky they weren't going to charge me a cancellation fee.  Then I find out they decided to groom other dogs that were in the neighboring house they were at that morning. This was ridiculous.  Clearly it was more convenient for them to take this other client and cancel on us, but this is poor business.  It has taken us weeks to get scheduled with another mobile groomer to take care of our dogs (which I have found to be much more professional).

Here's the story...........  I bought a 2009 Maxima from them in December.  I got what I wanted, traded my truck that was falling apart for a newer, nicer used car from Horne Kia.  I went in there with a loan from my bank already approved so I didn't need their financing.  I went in there with the loan approval number and was happy when they told me everything was good and they would get the information about my new car to the bank so they could complete the loan.  They didn't.  They opened a new loan with my bank so that they could make some money off the new loan that they started.  Now, this normally wouldn't be that big of a deal, aside from it causing my credit to be run again, but they lied about it to me, which is unacceptable.

So, with the purchase of my new, used car, I get a free oil change when it's due.  This brings me to this last Saturday, when I brought it in for it's first oil change.  I made an appointment for 9:30AM on Saturday to do a basic oil change.  My wife and I drop it off and they tell us it will take and hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes.  No problem since they seemed rather busy, we'll go get some breakfast.  So it's after 12:30 and still no call, I figure they may have forgotten to call us and we just head back there since it's been three hours.  Much our dismay, we get there and it's still in the same spot it was in when we left.  I go into the office, which is now virtually empty, and speak with the service advisor I dealt with earlier.  He tells me that they had to go get an oil filter from a parts store since it was a Nissan they were working on and they were a Kia dealership.  Well, that makes sense if I hadn't made an appointment 8 days earlier and they weren't expecting me.  But here's the real kicker; a 2009 Maxima takes the exact same oil filter as virtually every Kia from 2008 and before, as well as some 2010 Kia's.

Apparently this service advisor thought I wouldn't know this, as most people wouldn't, I'm sure.  When I asked him again what part it was they had to go get from a parts store, giving him the chance to be honest with me, he lied again.  Therefore, I presented him with this information and he instantly turned quite sheepish, not knowing what to say.  I proceeded to tell him that all we wanted was some honesty and they obviously don't deliver that at this dealership.  My wife and I walked away and he had nothing to say.

The turnaround was also amazing, we had our wedding on a Tuesday and had all the high res, edited shots in our hands by Friday.  He is great with lighting on the shots, and creates very interesting angles, at no point was the flash ever attached to his camera and placed in some corner of the room creating a great atmosphere to his photos.

He's great at making people feel comfortable, capturing candid moments and making it not feel like a chore.  To put it simply, I could not recommend him any higher, he is incredible at what he does and we couldn't be happier with the photos he produced.

Also, the staff isn't the friendliest.  Even when there aren't many people in the restaurant.  Not rude, per se, just not very welcoming.  And if you come during dinner, expect a considerable wait until you get your food.",2,X-IK7d1JIKVPWhgeiPO3pA,0.0

My problem is that the bagels I've purchased have been very hit or miss.

First fyi: the company charges 80 dollars an hour (for two movers).  There is a minimum 2 hour block to use the services.  And there is a one hour ""driving"" fee of 80 dollars to initially get to your place.  So, the very minimum the service will cost is 240 dollars.  Seemed pretty reasonable.

I hired All My Sons to move the furniture from a one bedroom apartment to a different unit in the same complex.  The new apartment was about 100 ft away from the first so there was no real ""driving time"" involved during the actual move.  All I really needed moved was a dining table, desk, bed, dresser, small file cabinet, and nightstand.  Shouldn't take more than 2 hours, right?  Wrong.  The workers moved slower than tar and continually used my bathroom and drank all my bottled water.  4 hours later, I just asked them to stop and said that I would pay what I owed.  Over 500 dollars later, I was still left with a ton of stuff to move on my own.  Also, they taped shut my dresser drawers and file cabinet doors with a tape they assured me would not damage the paint.  And when I started peeling the tape away, half of the paint came off with it.  They do not take of belongings and they scratched up the entire surface of my 1 month old white desk to the point I had to paint the entire thing over in a dark color.

If you're in need of trustworthy movers, try to use bekins or another more well established company.  You'll be much better off paying the slightly higher hourly rates for workers who actually work and don't damage your belongings.",33,X-IK7d1JIKVPWhgeiPO3pA,-0.20000000298023224

I went for dinner at around 6 and was seated at about 7:30 pm, BE PREPARED TO WAIT! Especially for dinner, I had a party of 3.

The hostess were very snotty and I was not told any party that's isn't for two must check in with the hostess and they will text you when your table is ready. I waited for about 20 mins before a hostess came to get information for each couple. At that point I was told to give them my information. There was a huge misunderstanding. Be various of the line, it is best to check in with the hostess first.

Once we were seated, I started off with the sweet potato fries which where delicious. The food overall was probably one of the best gourmet burgers I had. Although I am not a huge fan of over easy egg, the duck bacon was spot on and the combination of both gave it a great pazzaz.

Their menu features a wide variety of dishes - mostly typical Korean fare. However, people usually go for their cold noodles. They also feature an extensive list of Sundae (""soon-deh"") dishes, which is Korean sausage made with pig organs and intestines. Observing the other tables, I noted that it wasn't as popular as Naeng Myeon. However, keep in mind that it was a hot summer evening and the cold noodles are just that good. I personally like Sundae (spelling it like that is making me want ice cream...argh. I better switch to Soondae), and encourage you to try it!

Chik Bibim Naeng Myeon (Thin arrowroot noodles with a special sauce)
Win!
This was perfect for the hot day. The slushy broth, cooling veggies, chilled arrowroot noodles, and sliced hard-boiled egg made this the most satisfying bowl of noodles that I've had in Toronto. I chowed until all that was left was a puddle of the ""special spicy sauce"" which I loved. From what I observed, it's essentially hot pepper paste (gochu-jang), hot pepper flakes, and probably a bit of soy & minced garlic.
The slurried broth kept the dish chilled while I ate through my mother's plate of Tang Soo Yuk. My father and I shared dumplings & short ribs.
Anyways, I can quite honestly say that this was the best bowl of cold noodles that I've had to date, rivalling South Korea. While it may seem backwards to eat spicy food when it's hot, it was super satisfying and it didn't make me feel hotter at all.
Not a fan of spicy food? They offer Mul Naeng Myeon, which is essentially the same thing but without the spicy sauce (but that's what makes this so good, so please...get the bibim!!). It comes with seasonal fruit - watermelon was being served tonight. I like watermelon, but I love spice.
I also like squirting hot mustard all over my noodles. You can also add vinegar, but I don't like it in my Naeng Myeon.

Tang Soo Yuk (Korean-style Chinese dish. Sweet & Sour Pork)
Soggy :(
A childhood favourite of mine, this is an example of Korean-style Chinese cuisine. There are many dishes that you'll find in Korean restaurant under this niche - Jajamyeon (black bean noodles) is another popular example. Sticky-sweet, when it's done right the deep-fried pork, chicken, or beef has super crispy batter and is tender on the inside with a generous helping of sugary syrup, vegetables and fruit. Unfortunately, this was not done right. It was squishy, not crispy, which pretty much ruined the dish. Boo.

Kalbi (Grilled, marinated beef short ribs)
Skip this...
I've had better - much better. I am a bit of snob since I often make my own short ribs, but since I don't have a grill I like ordering them from restaurants. The cut of meat tasted low grade and fatty, and the flavour was lacking from the missing green onions. Moving on.

Mandu (dumplings Available fried or steamed)
Deep fried goodness!
Another dish that I often make on my own, I still like to order these in restaurants since I never deep-fry them at home. I was pleased with these, and I would order them again with my noodles over the kalbi any day!

I was a little frustrated with the service, but it was super-busy so I wasn't upset. The servers were rushing between tables, so they definitely weren't slacking. I was simply anxious to get my banchan because I was super hungry and jealously watching other tables get theirs while we were a little forgotten...even though we were right in front of the kitchen. Oddly, we received our mandu (dumplings) and kalbi (short ribs) before our banchan but again, they were under quite a bit of pressure so I didn't complain. We were also not given a box of cutlery, and it was hard to wave a server down. Needing something to eat the food on our table, I leaned over and swiped a box from another table.

On Pedestrian Sundays @ Kensington, Torontonians spill onto the car-free streets to enjoy a day of music, artsy performances, random shenanigans, and delicious face-stuffing. Held on the last Sunday of every month, it has a different atmosphere than some of the more widely advertised festivals.

I love wandering the streets as I shop at the various markets and try different treats. An extra Pedestrian Sunday was held on the 7th anniversary of the '03 Blackout - what a great way to thank a few overgrown Ohio trees for a spike in pregnancies (""blackout babies""), intense street-partying and raw sewage pouring into the Rideau Canal!

Although my major draw was The Bellevue's fish tacos (which was a fail since they didn't end up serving them the day that I went), I stuck around and did what I do best: explore and eat. 

Several restaurants were offering street-eats, both from their regular menu and PS-treats. Here's a run-down of what we tried:

Segovia
Patacone
Platanos with pulled pork and sauce
Empanadas
Stuffed Pobleno


El Gordo
Burrito Empanada
Churros


Fresco's Cuisine Inc. Fish & Chips
Kabobs


Other vendors were selling Indian cuisine, pastries, jewellery, and sandwiches. As we munched away, we wandered the streets and enjoyed the fun vibe. In the spirit of Pedestrian Sunday, some locals were playing music and there were children selling some fun treats.

An oyster-loving friend was happy to discover these on sale outside of New Seaway Fish Market. Shucked to order, there were 4 varieties: French Kiss, Lucky Lime (PEI), and Kumamoto (2 for $5) as well as a BC variety (3 for $5).",7,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,0.4000000059604645

Fantastic presentation, delicious dishes, and great company...I left happy and satisfied. Everything was so pretty - made for excellent food pr0n :P.

Overall, my impressions of Crown Princess Fine Dining are quite positive. Everything came out with great presentation and very fresh. It's easy to order if you don't have a friend who can speak Cantonese - but I am glad my friend was there to talk to the staff as we had to find out which dishes may have eggs or nuts due to an allergy at the table.

The dining area was very impressive - a banquet-sized dining area (you can rent it for weddings), tables outdoors (although it's getting cold...so I don't think I'll be sitting out there anytime soon), a side dining area, and a couple of private wings.

At $3.10 a dish before 11AM, the value felt good for the calibre of the food. I've been to Bright Pearl in downtown Chinatown, which is also a bit cheaper if you're not concerned about presentation and quality. Given it's location, wonderfully decorated dining areas, and delicious dishes I think it's safe to say that Crown Princess will be around for awhile!

They have the freshest waffle cones that I've tried (sorry Summers, you've been bumped!) and my favourite chocolate-peanut butter mixture so far.

The best part of the dark chocolate peanut butter is that there were generous slabs of peanut butter embedded throughout. With the fresh waffle cone, I say that this is my preferred choice over Coldstone and Marbleslab's Peanut butter chocolate concoctions.

Their Nutella ice cream is weak - if you want a chocolate-hazelnut treat I recommend going to Dolce Gelato instead. They also have ""Caribou Tracks"" which is the same as Kawartha's ever-popular moose tracks.

Spiced chutney & warm, crusty bread
I've come to appreciate a good spread that accompanies a nice bread basket. The spiced chutney was a pleasant start to the meal while my friend and I waited for the rest of our party to arrive. 

Tom Collins Cucumber Gazpacho
Lake Erie farms cucumber, lemon cress, preserved lemon, Canadian gin 
I enjoyed this version quite a bit. Never having tried a non-tomato gazpacho before, this was my first pick for lunch. I was very pleased with the light, refreshing flavour and great consistency. Unlike Biff's gazpacho, it was neither too creamy nor smooth. I prefer it with texture, and this one definitely rivals Boulevard Cafe's tomato-based gazpacho. I did not notice the gin, which is a good thing since I'm not a fan and I'd have to do a blind taste test to see if it made a difference. This was my favourite starter.

Smoked Black Cod Brandade
Crispy shallot rings, smoked paprika essence, confit garlic crostini
The crispy shallot rings were great with the paprika essence topped with a generous helping of the brandade. The texture was similar to very thick mashed potatoes, and the cod flavour was not too strong. This was the overall favourite appetizer of the table (but not mine!)

Shaved Fennel & Purple Basil Cress Salad
Spiced pistachio, taggiashi olive dust, orange gelée
I enjoyed this salad - the fennel had a good bite, the pistachios were great, and I enjoyed the orange gelée quite a bit. The gelée was sweet with a firm texture, which paired well with the vegetables.

Lake Erie Pickerel 
Wild rice coriander salad, Millbank green peas, marjoram cress, earth chardonnay vinaigrette
In spite of my typical hesitation to order fish, I have tried it at all of my Summerlicious outings this year. I was very glad that I did not miss out on this dish! The pickerel was cooked with the skin, which was nice and crispy and the wild rice salad was wonderful. The fish was seared very well, and was neither dry nor oily and was my favourite entree. I would order the fish at Globe Bistro again based on this!
 
Swiss Chard Torte Verde
Best Baa Farm feta, charred tomato coulis, blonde frisée, chives
The warm, baked feta on top of tomato coulis was quite savoury without an overpowering feta flavour. The tomato coulis had a cheesy taste and thick texture - I personally would have preferred a stronger charred tomato flavour instead but it was a great sauce to swirl the torte around before each bite.

Seared Cumbrae's Flank Steak
Duck fat Yukon chips, vine ripe tomato, scallion, Triple Crunch aioli
Carefully cooked, the steak was wonderfully pink and juicy. The aioli was a great accompaniment and steak's usual partner in crime - the fries - were quite tasty. Thickly cut and cooked in duck fat, they were enjoyed with each tender slice of steak. This was the overall favourite.

Callebaut Dark Chocolate Torte
Espresso mousse, Cherry Lane Farms black cherry sugar
Torte, torte, torte! Topped with mousse, this thick treat was a nice way to end the meal. I liked the torte at Biff's  a bit more, as it was a more moist and was served with a fruity sauce but this was a nice, satisfying variation as well. I love the density of torte, and the flavour of dark chocolate is something that I'll never tire of. I wasn't a huge fan of the espresso mousse - while good, I would prefer something a little sweeter/fruity/saucy for this dense dessert.

Globe Summer Berry ""Mess""
Vanilla spiced meringue, bacon infused whiskey, Ontario berries
Yum! I'm not usually a fan of meringue or  vanilla but this dessert was light and pleasant. The meringue was airy and sweet, and a great combination with the Ontario strawberries. The stiff peaks were lightly browned and the vanilla flavour was very pleasant with the sweet berries. 

Ewenity Crème Fraiche Panna Cotta 
Candied lemon zest, wild blueberry soup
This is the first panna cotta that I've enjoyed at a Summerlicious meal. I usually find it too creamy in taste, however joined with the blueberry soup and candied lemon this was great. I particularly enjoyed the lemon zest! The blueberry soup was akin to syrup and I'll admit that I took some torte and gave it a good swirl - it was fantastic. 

Overall, I was very pleased with my experience at Globe Bistro - definitely a nice way to end this year's Summerlicious escapades. Great service, good food made with local ingredients, and wonderful decor - a surefire recipe for a nice lunch or dinner. A pleasant bistro to go with friends or clients and it has a rooftop patio!

Note: not directly on Queen Street - the entrance is on Peter St! I almost thought I wrote the wrong address down and headed to O&B Canteen for a croissant.

This cute little coffee shop offers an array of sandwiches, croissants, muffins, and cookies. Best of all, you can get hot fresh donuts that are made to order!

They're quick and efficient and watching the donuts being made within seconds of ordering was a delight for my inner child. Once done, they're thrown into a bowl and tossed with sugar and cinnamon before being thrown into a paper bag or a bowl if you prefer...but it's much more fun to get it in the paper bag :P

The entire café is noticeably tidy & clean, and I found the lady quite pleasant (not that the guy wasn't - he was just busy and I was slow to choose a drink). She also took care to ensure that every order of donut was cooked to perfection :)

Yum! These donuts disappeared quickly . They're the perfect size to just pop in your mouth, and not heavy at all. They're super fresh, hot, and a delicious treat. I got a full dozen for $4 - worth every penny :)

Summer Berry Pudding
Raspberries, strawberries, red currants, and vanilla whipped cream
While tasty, I think that this would've been better topped on top of a cake rather than being served as a messy slab of pudding. It was more mushy than pudding-y.

Coffee and Donut
Chocolate espresso pot de creme with dulce de leche whipped cream and cinnamon sugared mini donut
Cute presentation - chilled pot de creme had a nice chocolate-espresso flavour, but I wish it was a bit stronger or denser or had bits of chocolate in it.
The donut was quite disappointing. Despite being made in-house, both the twist and the donut were stale and lacked flavour. I would have been happier with a Timbit from Tim Hortons - for 16 cents!",4,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,-0.20000000298023224

The lightly breaded and deep-fried rings and tentacles were tender and neither overcooked nor too salty - two things that often ruin calamari. It wasn't put in the deep fryer for too long, so it wasn't especially crispy and the batter was so-so. I personally would have liked a bit more spice. It was okay, but I've had better value from Mezes in Greektown. The *best* calamari I've ever tried was from Yoso's-Call Joso's in Yorkville - pricey, but spiced and fried to perfection. Would not order calamari from Wish again.
 
Romaine Salad w Cherry Tomatoes, Herb Dressing, Feta Cheese, & Crostini  
The waitress made a strong recommendation for the salad - she raved that she loved it and it is really great starter. Really? I think the picture speaks for itself. Romaine lettuce, a couple cherry tomatoes and an unmemorable dressing. Very poor value at $9.
 
Lamb Burger with Tomato Tzatziki & Feta
The saving grace of our lunch - the lamb was nicely ground and mixed with a good dash of cumin. Tender and juicy, I savoured it to make up for the disappointing salad and so-so calamari. The bun was a typical white hamburger-type of bun - too bad, really. I think that a great bun on a good burger makes a world of difference. The fries were decent - nice, thin, a little on the softer side (like the calamari! Perhaps this is just their style)

The patio and interior are simple and great for a summer brunch or lunch. Fresh, sunny flowers at each table, simple decor, and comfy couches created a low-key, relaxed atmosphere. However, for the value I don't think I will be returning for lunch...although I may give the weekend brunch another go. Maybe.",1,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,0.10000000149011612

A very late dinner on Pi-Tom's patio coupled with pleasantly humid weather made a few of us reminisce of travels to Asia. Usually bustling & full during dinner, we arrived around 9pm and had full reign of the patio! Still decorated from the Pride Parade, the colourful patio is enveloped in plants and trees, making you forget that you're in the downtown core.  

Yum Mamuang (Mango Salad)
Green mango, red onion, chili, mint leaves, lemon juice
A great start to our dinner, the ingredients were fresh and the lemon juice-chili combination complimented the mangoes quite well. The mangoes were ripe, but still had enough bite so you can get a good stab with your fork each time. The balance between fruit and vegetables was great - too much red onion can kill a mango salad.


Fish Cakes
Deep-fried ground white fish mixed with chili and long bean
What a pleasant surprise - when I heard ""fish cakes"" I was expecting spongy slivers of processed fish. Instead, we received tasty well-marinated slices accompanied with a hearty peanut sauce. The sauce was full of peanuts and flavour with a smooth, non-oily texture. I ended up scooping leftovers on some rice, yum!

Chicken Satay
4 skewers of marinated chicken served with cucumber salad
Tender, juicy chicken with a sweet & salty flavour - I wish these were sold on the street. They'd be the perfect snack! A simple yet winning appetizer.

The servers were very friendly. The food came quick throughout the night, and upon request they gave us a jug of water to save the waitress the hassle of constantly refilling our glasses. We did not realize that they closed at 10pm, but they did not rush us out of the restaurant and did not seem annoyed that we were unknowingly staying well past their closing time.
 
Authentic Pad Thai
Thai rice noodles stir fried with sweet & sour tamarind sauce, chicken, shrimp, root vegetable, bean sprouts, tofu, coconut sauce, wrapped in a fried egg crepe
What a difference from ketchup-based pad thai! Tamarind is by far the superior sauce. While ketchup (or ""sweet and sour tomato sauce"" as some restaurants call it) is very sugary, tamarind gave it a more tangy flavour and the portion in the egg crepe was quite generous. It wasn't sopping with sauce, and there meat, noodle, and sprouts ratio was great, and everything was cooked quite nicely

Duck Curry
Roasted duck in curry, lychee, bamboo shoots, peppers, and basil
Full of bell peppers, broccoli and bamboo shoots, this aromatic curry was deliciously packed with flavour and roasted duck. To be honest, I didn't notice lychee...probably because I was too busy wolfing everything down!The curry was wonderfully seasoned; sweet, comforting and the favourite dish of the night for our table.

Peanut Chicken
Chicken stir-fried with peanut sauce & long bean
The simple peanut chicken dish was very flavourful with moist bites of chicken. As expected, it had a very strong peanut taste, but wasn't at all pasty in texture. While yummy on a summer night, I can really see myself enjoying a bowl in the winter - and Pi-Tom's does delivery!

Plamuek Pad Prik (Spicy Squid)
Squid in hot pepper sauce with bamboo shoots and basil sauce
A generous offering of vegetables and squid, this plate disappeared quickly! Green beans, carrots, bamboo shoots, onions, and squid, all smothered and cooked in an addictive basil sauce. Even when the food was gone, we were spooning the sauce on rice until the plate was super clean!

Goong Pong Ka-Ree (Stir Fried Shrimp Dinner Special)
Stir-fried shrimp with curry powder, egg, onion, chili garlic sauce, sweet peppers.  Served with pineapple fried rice and pineapple salad.
Another favourite of the table - although the pineapples were canned, the salad was nice to scoop up with the shrimp and rice. The fried rice wasn't greasy (something that I'm usually wary of), and the shrimp had a great kick that kept us going back for more. 

By the end of the night, all of us left happy & satisfied. Every single dish was full of flavour, the service was pleasant, and the patio was welcoming. A surprisingly delicious find, just off of Yonge Street and I will be back to try their soups and sticky-rice dessert!

*Update*
Pi-Tom's Mango Sticky Rice  (~$6)
Thumbs down. I suppose I can't fault them for the blah mango - peak season has come and gone. 
Mango Sticky Rice is supposed to be salty & sweet...I would've liked a bit more of a salty flavour in the coconut-milk. I could be wrong, but perhaps the rice wasn't soaked enough in the coconut-milk or maybe there wasn't enough (to my liking anyways. I'm no Thai-dessert expert) because I would've liked a milkier consistency.",8,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,0.4000000059604645

I liked them all - the lemonade was the most refreshing for the hot day, but I enjoyed the banana-chocolate- jalpeno flavour the most. With a consistency that's more shake-y than juice-y (makes sense given the ingredients), I enjoyed a jalapeño ""bite"" after each chocolately slurp. I wish they used a darker chocolate instead though - I think that the stronger cacao taste would go really well with the jalapeño.

The honeydew-avocado-banana was light, sweet and also on the thicker side. Next time, I think I will ask for some ice cubes in my drink even though it will dilute it a bit more just to keep it cold.

The Squirrel ($10)
Peanut butter, sardines, hot chili sauce, cucumber, sprouts and white cheddar on dark rye
How could I not order this? The combination of salty, buttery, cheesy, and spicy was pretty darn good. I just wish there was more! At $10 though, it's not bad considering the big bowl of soup that came with it.

I'd love to try this with a few slices of tomato and avocado. My friend disagrees saying that it's just make it too soggy but I think it'd be great. I think I will request that addition next time, if possible. I like tomatoes on everything though...

The Beach ($10)
Chick pea salad, roasted coconut, yakinori, sesame, sprouts, and cheddar on dark rye
Not bad, a decent healthy sandwich. The chickpeas were chickpeas, the sprouts were sprouts - I got exactly what I ordered. While tasty, I won't be craving it anytime soon and I'd sooner try something else off of their menu.

The Fish Fry ($14)
Golden fried Ontario Rainbow Trout, with a dandelion & avocado mixed green salad, white vinaigrette.
The Rainbow Trout was well done, although I wish there was more to the salad. I wonder how much it would have cost to upgrade to the Greens with Envy salad? Purple kale, dandelion, cucumber, green onion, sprouts, and broccoli sounds pretty darn good.

The following two items come with sandwiches, or you can order them separately.
Soupe de Soleil ($4)
The butternut squash and was thick, filling, and satisfying. I actually like my squash soups a bit chunky so I was quite happy with this homey bowl. There was also a bit of tomato & scallions and possibly carrot, if I recall correctly. Yum.

Black Beans ($6)
The black bean dip with avocado was also tasty with the red tortilla chips. Dense and chunky, the bowl was spooned clean. I wished there were a few more large chips in the pile, but no biggie - I just scooped some dip with my spoon with the little chip bits. In hindsight, I think I would've liked this in the sandwich too!

Julies' Pies!
Ooh...pie. With Wanda's Pie in the Sky down the street I was surprised to see ""Julies' Pie"" for dessert. I racked my poor memory for a bakery named Julie's and drawing a blank, I asked where/who Julie('s) is. It turns out that one of the owner's (Ryan) cousin's wife bakes yummy desserts for their cafe. Talk about family love :) It was a sweltering hot day, but he convinced me that the pie was ""reaaaalllly good"" with a knowing ""omg"" look on his face. Not that my sweet tooth ever needs much convincing anyways.

And ""reaaaallly good"" it was! Totally catering to my not-so-secret love affair with Ontario peaches, the filling was just the right amount of sweet and the crust (which I think is just as important!) was nice and soft. While my friend said he would've preferred more of a ""bite"" for both the peaches and the crust, I was quite satisfied as I liked the super-soft pieces of fruit. Mmmm. It wasn't syrupy or overloaded with sugar. This pie-lover was satisfied.

The service from co-owner Chris was very friendly and conversational. I heard they were going to offer fish tacos at yesterday's Pedestrian Sundays however a combination of a precarious weather forecast and something about the cousin who was going to cook 'em up made it a no-go. I must have looked crest-fallen as I got a consoling tap on the shoulder from Ryan (is it creepy that I'm using their first names as if I know them?) and a promise of their appearance on August 29th's Pedestrian Sunday. Sadly I will be out of town, but as a fanatic of Little Italy's Fish Store, at least I know where to get my fish-fix. Pout.

Overall, I had a good time at The Bellevue. While there were some things that I would like to tweak, everything tasted good and homey. The items are things that I could easily make at home, but the creative combinations certainly stirred my imagination. It won't be long before I start making my own Sardine-Nut Butter-Rye sandwiches...which may or may not be pleasant for The Bellevue to hear!",1,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,0.30000001192092896

Brightly lit and very clean, the interior looked newly renovated and ready for some hungry paddlers. We grabbed a table and were promptly given menus, which we scoured for the meatiest, tastiest sounding dishes. Paddling 20km during a 3 hour torrential downpour makes you hungry.

Sweet Smoke is both family-friendly and a good hang out, and the owner and the waitresses provided great service. After dinner, the owner was quite chatty and talked about how he slow cooked his pork and what he thought of his competition. It was a very relaxed atmosphere for a casual Saturday night dinner. They also serve homemade iced tea - sweetened, brewed tea which I found better than the bottled variety. 

Grilled Portobello Mushroom Melt
Arugula, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Grilled Red Onions, Gruyère Cheese, Guajillo Aioli on Toasted Rosemary Focaccia
A generous helping of portobello paired extremely well with the gruyère. This is the same cheese that Biff's used for their crepes, and I must say that I am a fan! Although I'm not usually a fan of cheesy sandwiches, gruyère pairs very well with meat and vegetables, this sandwich being no exception. I especially enjoyed the toasted focaccia bread. Warm, ""meaty"" with mushrooms, and toasty - this was my second favourite sandwich!

Southwestern Club
Hickory Smoked Turkey, Crispy Pancetta, Tomato, Greens, Avocado and Chipotle Mayonnaise on Ciabatta
We were surprised to receive this sandwich, because we only inquired about it but didn't actually order it (whoops). It didn't matter - we were so hungry that it was a welcome appearance so there was no need to complain or send it back. The smoked turkey was nice and juicy, the ciabatta was was buttered and grilled. I would have liked a bit more pancetta for additional flavour. Decent sandwich, but the mushroom melt definitely eclipsed this sandwich. Even though it was my least favourite sandwich of the night, it was still tasty!

El Cubano 
Pulled Pork, Shaved Smoked Turkey, Manchego Cheese and Quick Pickles on Sesame Seed Bun
Y-U-M! This was the best sandwich of the night. Smokey turkey, tender pulled pork, tangy sauce, and pickles was a great combination. Although it would probably be considered ""nontraditional"" for a pulled pork sandwich, I would have preferred it with the rosemary focaccia bread from the portobello mushroom melt and melted cheese. I liked the quick pickles quite a bit, I wouldn't mind ordering a side of them the next time I go in. The toasted sesame seed bun was soft & good, but wish it was a little more toasted - but the combination of the pulled pork and the turkey was heavenly so no complaints! Sammy win!

Flat Iron Steak Burrito 
Drunken Beans, Queso Fresco, Ancho Chile Salsa and Cilantro
Unable to find a great steak burrito in Toronto (tried Burrito Boyz, Burro Burrito, Big Fat Burrito and Burrito Loco) I felt like I was taking a chance ordering this. It came tender, juicy, and oh-so-delicious with melted cheese and great salsa. It was a good simple burrito, the meat was very well cooked - I wish it was jammed a bit more with veggies but considering that I wasn't at a burrito joint I can't expect to get a fat burrito. I wish there was a fast food burrito as tender as this...

Mixed Barbecue Sampler
Hickory Smoked BBQ Ribs, Slow Smoked Pulled Pork, Cowboy Beans, and Jicama slaw
I came for the pulled pork, but when I spotted an item that gave you pulled pork and ribs, I was sold! The pulled pork was great - tender, juicy, smokey, and full of flavour. Everything I look for in pulled pork. While some might be turned off by the orange-coloured sauce, I happened to love the citrus flavour. If I could tweak one little thing, it would be the hickory flavour - more please!
The ribs however, were a little on the dry side but they still had a nice smokey flavour that I enjoyed. They weren't too dry, but I've had better.
The beans were tasty and saucy but the slaw was just slaw - I later learned that many people top their sandwiches with the slaw. I would've tried it if it occurred to me!

Cake and Shake!
Blackout Cake with Dark Chocolate Pudding, and Vanilla Bean Milkshake
The chocolate fiend in me was definitely satisfied with this rich, moist cake. Creamy chocolate mousse layers nestled between dense cake was a great way to end the meal. If you like frothy and richly-flavoured milk shakes, you will love this. Mmm...

If you're looking for a savoury sandwich, Oakville's Sweet Smoke Barbecue & Grill is worth a visit! Friendly service (although we did accidentally get a sandwich that we didn't order), warm meaty sandwiches, and a bright interior made this a great place to grab a bite.",3,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,0.5

Tried:
Eggs Charlotte ($11.50)
Insomnia's hollandaise sauce has a bit of a cheesy flavour. It adds a bright colour and if you like a bit of cheese, then you'll probably prefer Insomnia's hollandaise over some other breakfast joints. The eggs were well poached - not as perfectly as Hoof Cafe's but still nice and runny and the side of greens was good to nosh on between bites.

Eggs Manami ($10)
Ordered off of their ""Brunch Features"" menu, the Eggs Manami had wonderful curried rice patties. This is a delicious alternative to English muffins, and I recommend this over their regular Eggs Benny.!

Home Fries
Their home fries are great! The potatoes are freshly tossed in a bbq-y sauce, and they're not at all soggy. These were quickly snarfed and definitely worth adding to your order if they don't come with it anyways.

French Toast
Heaven on Earth ($10.50)
Yummy - It was crispy and filling with a generous amount of fruit. The cream cheese was good, but I would've enjoyed it just as much without. I'm not so sure that the strawberries were wild as advertised, but they were fresh! This was great drenched in maple syrup.

Baked Pancakes ($10)
So these aren't so much pancakes as cakes-baked-in-a-pan. They are huge and are made to order and from scratch. They are very thick and dense, and take at least 20 minutes upon ordering to arrive. We were definitely stuffed after polishing these off!
 
Chocolate Banana Pancakes & Apple Cinnamon Pancakes
While good, I don't think I'd order it for myself but as a post-breakfast treat to share with a larger group.

Overall, Insomnia is a bright cheery breakfast joint in the Annex. I recommend it if you're looking for a tasty brunch at a great value. Their pleasant service, bright dining and bar areas, and great brunch options make it a great choice. Definitely a step up from other local breakfast joints that I've tried with respect to service, atmosphere and quality of food. Get the home fries and their egg dishes are quite tasty.

I've also been there for dinner. If you go, you *must* try their Climax Cake. It's as good as the name suggests ;). Flourless chocolate torte, wonderfully dense and rich - I would return just for that dessert alone! Their pizzas are also quite good and named after Toronto neighbourhoods - I tried their Annex pizza. Their Mediterranean Platter and fries with aioli are decent appetizers to share with the table - but the pizza would be better.

Knowing that it takes 20-30 minutes for the food to be prepared, we ordered one of their House Specials to tide us over as well as some white rice.

Szechwan Shredded Beef ($10.95
)Crispy yet tender, crunchy but not oily, this was the perfect dish to ease our hunger pangs while we waited for the duck. I was really pleased with the beef; it had great flavour from the chili and it wasn't drenched in sauce so it stayed crispy. Shredded carrots and green onions added to the flavour, and it was great with rice.

Authentic Beijing Roast Duck (3 Courses) ($37.95)
1. Crispy Duck Skin & Breast
2. Duck Stir Fry
3. Duck Soup

Course 1: Crispy, Roasted Skin
I could hardly contain my excitement when the first course arrived. The dark skin was shining and crispy-looking, with duck breast peeking out from underneath.The flavour was fantastic. There was also little to no fat hiding between the skin and breast, which but they've rendered it so well that it was still moist.
With it came steamed dry crepes to wrap the roasted duck, vegetables, tian mian jian (a savoury-sweet bean sauce), and crispy shrimp crackers. The crepes are nice and thin, but thick enough to wrap everything without breaking before shoving it into your mouth. Eat the crackers while they're super-fresh and hot - like pork rinds, they get soft and blah over time.

Course 2: Minced, Fried Duck in Lettuce Wraps
There were also bits of crispy white noodles hidden among the pile of stir fried duck, vegetables, and saucey goodness. The sweet bean sauce is a great base for stir fries, and II enjoyed tofu, water chestnuts, pepper, carrots, onion, and whatever other vegetables were in the mix. There was just enough to give it flavour, and they clearly weren't just ""fillers"" for the dish to look bigger.
We eagerly grabbed spoonfuls and scooped the duck into pieces iceberg lettuce. I also enjoyed it with white rice when we ran out of lettuce. Win.

Course 3: Duck Soup
Last to arrive was a soup made from the remaining skin, meat, and bones. The broth was surprisingly light and tasty - not at all oily! A friend said this was her favourite course for this very reason. I really wonder what they put in this broth to make it so flavourful in such a short amount of time. Tofu, duck, and nappa cabbage was plentiful and we cleaned this bowl up without a problem. I can only imagine how wonderful this soup must be on a cold, winter night.",5,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,0.4000000059604645

It's my favourite in Toronto along with Big Fat's Pulled Pork Burrito. I'm curious about BFB's breakfast one! I'm so addicted to the halibut though, that I can't seen to order anything else from BBz. I am in such a late night burrito mood tonight!

 

I had to award both Burrito Boyz and Big Fat Burrito #1 to be fair. When I am craving a fish burrito, I go to BB. When I want something meaty, I go to BFB. It's as simple as that.

1a. Burrito Boyz
Halibut Burrito ($8.85 small, $9.73 large
)Halibut Burrito - so much sauce, so much win!
The tortilla is toasted on a flat-top grill and the large gives you 1.5 lb of fish! Add a very generous helping of sauces: Lime-Chili Burrito sauce, sour cream, and hot sauce. Most of my friends get little to no hot sauce, but I like asking for two lines. Yum.
I almost wrote this place off after trying their steak burrito - the beef was tough and unappetizing, despite the plethora of fillings. I'm really glad that I gave the place another go and tried their halibut burrito! I can ever resist its call...while curious about their veggie soy and shrimp burritos, I haven't been able to say no to halibut.
1b. Big Fat Burrito
Pulled Pork
I lo-o-o-ve their pulled pork burrito! It's always saucy, soft, and so good with guacamole. I always manage to stuff myself with a large without a single regret! You can get some yam in it too!

3. Burrito Bandidos
Steak Burrito
This is third because I only tried their steak - I bet their fish is just as good as Burrito Boyz. If I was ranking this on the steak alone, it'd be lower but I ought to be fair since the owners used to work together at Burrito Boyz so they're virtually identical.

4. Z-teca
Beef Barbacoa Burrito
Tried the one at Fairview Mall - this a popular chain. Pretty good if you're in the area and want a burrito fix! They're also often featured on Group Buy sites, so keep your eyes open for deals.

5. Chipotle Mexican Grill
Carnitas
Owned by McDonalds, this has been a major hit-or-miss for me. The last time I went, the person who made my burrito jammed it full of Carnitas and I was very pleased. The time before that, the server was quite grumpy and I got a small handful of chicken. Nonetheless, when I needed a quick burrito fix around Yonge & Dundas, Chipotle did the trick...until Big Fat Burrito moved in. I rather like their Cilantro-Lime flavoured rice

6. Burro Burrito
Steak ($7.99 Large)
Located beside my beloved Fish Store, I popped by after a game of floor hockey. This was in my early burrito-blitzing days and I think that I've since realized that steak burritos are not the way to go unless if you're ordering them from a good restaurant like my visit to Sweet Smoke's BBQ

7. Burrito Loco
Chicken Burrito
So close to being finished before the picture was taken! Oops!

Of course, there's also Sweet Smoke's Flat Iron Steak burrito but since it's at a restaurant it's in a totally different class on it's own.
Steak Burrito win @ $9, but not quick eats on the streets of Toronto

Honourable Mentions - Not true Burritos but I still love 'em:
1. The Fish Store
Tried almost everything - best: Black Cod Burrito with Avocado
Honestly, if this was open later and closer to my place I'd get this over Burrito Boyz any day. The Fish Store is fantastic - they offer a huge selection of seafood that you can in sandwich or a wrap (which they call a burrito). Love Love Love.

2. NY Subway
Potato burrito, cauliflower burrito, lamb burrito
These aren't traditional burritos either - however their potato & cauliflower burritos are great! Totally recommend getting one of these over their meaty options.",2,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,0.30000001192092896

A fantastic outdoor back patio includes an outdoor bar and lounge areas. 

The service was pleasant and patient - We were given a bread basket with crispy flat bread seasoned with tarragon and a few slices of white bread. It was accompanied with a rather plain marinara sauce, which foreshadowed the upcoming meal.

Baby Red Romaine & Escarole Salad
Cara Cara orange, fennel, shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and old wine vinaigrette 
A light start of fresh lettuce, a slightly tart vinaigrette, ripe Cara Cara orange, and cheese. While the orange and the dressing was enjoyable, something was left to be desired...perhaps it's because of my unrefined wine and cheese palette, but I wasn't particularly impressed. Memorable Summerlicious starter salads include the butterleaf truffle salad at Truffles at the Four Seasons (which has since closed) and Tutti Matti's carpaccio salads.

Bigeye Tuna Tartare & Spicy Sopressata 
Cracked olives, garlic grissini, arugula, lemon and Sicilian organic extra virgin olive oil 
Fresh tuna tartare on a bed of salami was a welcome dish, especially since I've never tried sopressata before. The saltyness of the cured ham paired with the freshnesses of the tuna created an interesting balance between bites. The olives were typical, and the bread sticks brought a crunch but no flavour to the plate. Perhaps if they were toasted a bit more or rolled in sesame, it would've been a nice compliment to the dish.

Wild & Tame Mushroom Soup 
Six kinds of mushrooms (no butter or cream)
Thick, warm, and hearty - this had the rich texture of a comforting soup despite the lack of cream or butter. I was impressed with the consistency and I love the taste of mushrooms so I thoroughly enjoyed this soup. As with the salad, there was something lacking - the ""wow"" factor that I always hope for at 'licious restaurants. The best mushroom soup that I've tasted was Wild Mushroom Soup from Tutti Matti - unfortunately not on their current menu.


Grilled Top Sirloin Fettina
Charred onion, heirloom tomato and rocket salad with crumbled Gorgonzola
The vegetables were nice and warm, and the sauce surrounding the steak sweet however the steak wasn't particularly interesting or great. Tender and nicely cooked, it was a good, simple cut of sirloin but didn't blow me away or leave a lasting impression on my palette.

Grilled Jail Island Salmon
Pickled summer beets, heirloom carrots, watercress salad and horseradish crème fraîche
Despite my half-success with the fish at Biff's Bistro, I decided that it was worth another go. While tasty, I'm quickly getting bored with this Summerlicious lunch. The beets were nice, warm, and soft and the horseradish crème fraîche had great flavour. However the salmon was...just salmon.

Roasted Portobello Mushroom & Brie Quesadilla
Caramelized onions, pico de gallo, chipotle crema, plantain tortilla chips and cilantro cress
My personal favourite of the entrées, the chipotle cream had a tangy flavour that tasted great with the pico de gallo and quesadilla. The pico de gallo (salsa) was ripe and simple. Always a fan of portobello, these quesadillas had great flavour. While an interesting visual, the tortilla chips were lacking the flavour I usually enjoy from plantains. As a plantain chip lover, they were a disappointment. I'd rather crack open a bag of the Samai Plantain chips that I got addicted to Barbados.

Chocolate Toffee Crunch Cheesecake
Dulce de leche cream
Thick cheesecake that was more toffee-like than chocolate. The caramel was pleasant with the dense cake. I wasn't a fan of the bit of toffee that accompanied the cake but overall I'd say that this was the best dessert out of the three.


Bavarian Vanilla Cream
Ontario strawberry compote and dark cherry balsamic
Nice and warm with a smooth texture, the vanilla cream dessert sat on one of the better compotes that I've tried. I found myself scooping this dessert up more for the compote than the cream.

Coconut Rum Baba 
Tropical fruit salad and banana cream
This spongy cake was covered with coconut shavings over pineapple, mango, and lychee. A sweet, generous drizzle of rum syrup soaked into the cake quite nicely. While I wasn't the biggest fan of this dessert initially, over time as I enjoyed my company it grew on me. It wasn't too rich or filling.

Wonderfully designed and decorated, Jump Café & Bar creates a vibrant, young, and upscale environment quite well. I would return for a drink at the bar, and the service was fantastic. However, I thought it was missing that the ""oomph"" factor that would make me wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for future Summerlicious romps.

That's not to say that the portion sizes aren't generous - because they are! It was just that good. Instead of picking two out of three entrees that we really wanted, we just tacked on another plate. You gotta make the visit count, right?

Excited to Hoof-it-up, I got there a bit early and was surprised to find a line quickly gather behind me. Luckily, I was relaxing on the bench & enjoying the Sunday morning otherwise I wouldn't have gotten a table (not that the bar would've been bad). By 9:45AM, quite a few fellow brunchers were eagerly peering through the window in anticipation of the 10AM opening time.

The cafe itself is quite small, so go early if you want to avoid a wait or would prefer a seat by the window. Similarly, I arrived at Black Hoof right when they opened at 6PM, and just managed to grab a table. I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar though, they have fantastic cocktails and the service is jovial and chatty. However, for a group of more than 3 people a table is clearly better.

Bone Marrow Strawberry Beignets
Winning Combination: Cinnamon, Sugar, Bone Marrow, Strawberries & Long Peppers
These delicious little bone marrow pastries are coated in sugar and cinnamon. The donuts were hot, fresh, and filled with a sweet strawberry and long pepper jelly. Deep fried bits of joy, these were the perfect size and a tasty $5 appetizer. More please!
The two other starters are currently available for $5; a pastry filled with bacon as well as ribs in a beer sauce. While curious about the others, these donuts were a winning choice. Well...honestly based on the entire meal, I'm convinced that anything would be a solid option!

Beef Tongue Grilled Cheese
When I spotted this on the menu, succulent memories of Beef Tongue on Brioche from Black Hoof wafted through my mind. Slathered and fried, the buttery bread had toasty grill marks and neatly sandwiched an extremely tender and generous portion of beef tongue. I needed to erase the disaster that was Friday's T&T's rubbery beef tongue from my mind and this just blew it away. Hello satisfaction.
Packed with comforting flavour, every bite made me stop to savour the combination of Provolone, Brie, crispy-buttery bread, and amazing thinly-shaved beef tongue. The little piggy-skewer with 4 pickles was a nice touch, similar to Black Hoof's Beef Tongue on Brioche Sandwich. Between the two, I'd say that this was better...but trust me...they are both delicious. Not bad for my first grilled cheese sandwich!

Suckling Pig Eggs Benny
Perfectly runny egg yolks, light Hollandaise sauce over pickled jalapeño
The Eggs Benny was perfectly poached. Warm yolk slowly oozed out when pierced with a fork, and every bite was covered in heavenly Hollandaise sauce. The sauce wasn't too rich, and did not mask the wonderful porky flavour on top of the fresh biscuit. The suckling pig had a barbecue flavour, and reminded me of very tender pulled pork without the sauce. The arugula had a lemony zip and the dish was surrounded by pork rinds. I could be wrong, but the rinds tasted like they were made a bit earlier as they were a bit soft rather than hot and crispy. They were spiced with barbecue powder. While a nice touch, I didn't care so much for them.
I recently told a friend that my next food-hunt would be for Toronto's best Eggs Benedict. However, I'm pretty sure that now I've tasted this, there is no need. Even without the suckling pig, this eclipses all other Eggs Benny dishes I've ever had.

Brioche French Toast with Foie Gras
O-M-G.
I could easily leave the description as that, because that is all that was running through my mind when we received it, while I was eating it, and after it was done.
The Brioche French Toast was perfect - the thick French bread was perfectly battered & fried, covered in sweet-syrupy goodness, roasted macadamia nuts, a dollop of creme fraiche, and bright red strawberries. Oh, and quite possibly the largest serving of Foie Gras that I've ever seen i my life.
Words can't describe how great I thought it was - sweet syrup, hot fresh brioche, seared Foie Gras, macadamia nuts, creme fraiche, and fruit. How could this not be amazing?! Now I want every restaurant to start making French Toast with brioche. Like the Eggs Benny, this wins the C&T prize for Toronto's Best French Toast. Sorry Kalendar, but your banana & mango stuffed French toast was just trumped BIG TIME.
A $26 plate French Toast might sound quite steep (it's $12 for the French Toast and $14 for the Foie Gras) but I definitely think that it's worth a try at least once. Go with a few friends and split it if you need to...
Everything about the the meal was great. From the upbeat and friendly service to the colours and presentation of each plate.

Charcuterie Platter ($16 small/$25 large) & Thuet Bread ($2 small/$4 large
)This is a wonderful introduction for those who have never tried charcuterie. Basically, charcuterie is a series of meaty products (cured, whipped & other preparation techniques) served on a wooden platter.
All offered with a pile of full-seeded mustard, a dish of teeny-tiny pickled vegetables, and we ordered Thuet Bread on the side. The Thuet bread was soft & fresh - a great accompaniment.
The star was the foie gras mousse - whipped to perfection, it just melts in your mouth.

Roasted Bone Marrow ($9)
Hollowed with a little spoon & sprinkled with a bit of coarse salt on top of warm, smoky bread, this was tasty and good for the immune system. I reminded myself of the health benefits as I savoured each bit of fatty, rich, comforting flavour.

Tongue in Brioche ($13)
The sandwich was a ridiculously generous portion of thinly sliced beef tongue between two plump slices of fragrant brioche, all held together with a skewered cornichons. A healthy (hah!) dose of mustard and tarragon mayo drizzled all over made my heart skip - whether it was in fear or excitement, I'm still not sure.
Incredibly soft and tender, prior to this delight I didn't know that tongue could be this delectable. While I prefer the buttery & decadent Tongue Grilled Cheese at Hoof Cafe, I would never turn down this sandwich.

Raw Horse Sammy w/ Hot Sauce ($22)
Fresh bread topped with horse tartar with a raw egg yolk & shallots on one slice, and a liberal helping of hot sauce on the other. The ""HORSE"" spelled out in sauce was a fun touch. I couldn't believe how tasty the raw horse meat was - I tried it with and without the hot sauce & bread to get a sense of the true flavour.

Crispy Pig Ear Salad
Strips of breaded & deep-fried pig ears over radishes, carrots, edible flowers with a lime buttermilk dressing
I liked the pig ears, but I found the dressing too buttery and generous on the salad. As someone who prefers light, acidic dressing (or none at all with the right greens!) it was unappetizing. However, I was at the Black Hoof so this was to be expected.
The pig ears were crispy as advertised, and full of fatty-flavour with each bite. A dining companion claims that Buca does a better version...

Fluke Crudo
Fluke along with charred fava beans, avocado cream, sliced chili, pancetta, herbs & cilantro dressing.
I really liked the avocado cream and fava beans. A little heavy on the dressing (but again, it's Hoof!) but the combination of the sliced chili & cilantro was delightful with the fish. Love the plating :)

N'Duja & Corn Tagliatelle
House tagliatelle noodles with charred corn, charred cherry tomatoes, and the n'duja which is a spicy calabrese salami melted into the pan. Garnished with a green onion salad on top.
Mmm. I realy enjoyed this - house pasta was al dente and the creamy sauce blended very well with the charred corn and tomatoes. I still have trouble pronouncing it, but the n'duja was quite tasty with a bit of heat and I would happily order this dish again. Creamy, spicy, & corny goodness. I love sweet corn!

Pork Belly, Squid,& Melon
Baby squid, Berkshire pork belly & chunks of melon in a watermelon glaze with turmeric, cumin. Flaxseed, Vietnamese cilantro, mint, & basil also riddle this succulent dish.
While the pork belly and the squid were both well done and delicious, the pairing did not do much for each other. They were enjoyed separately with the watermelon glaze. I must have gotten a good chunk of watermelon, as a dining partner-in-crime said she didn't taste the melon but I certainly did. As usual, the pork belly made me pause to fully enjoy the flavour. So decadent and perfectly pan-cooked.

Calf's Brain Ravioli
House ravioli in sage, brown sugar, & butter sauce with Parmesan shavings
So...It was an oily mess, and I was very glum as a result. From the poor presentation, meagre calf brain filling, blah pasta, and too-sharp cheese I reluctantly ate all 5 raviolis wondering why I was even bothering with each bite. It was cooked al dente, just like the tasty tagliatelle, but I don't think that that is the best way to cook ravioli. Sigh. A fellow diner sampled a bit of my dish and agreed that it was simply not good. Darn it. But that's 1 bad dish out of so many amazing ones...so all is forgiven =)

Formerly the Imperial Palace, only the name has changed. The location on the strip is prime, but the building should be demolished and rebuilt. The only reason I'm giving The Quad a one star rating is because I haven't figured out how to give it a negative rating.
  
Navigating the nightmarish layout from the self parking garage to the hotel was made extra special by the young man urinating while his buddies unloaded their beer coolers from their car.       

Checking in was ok, but just ok. The staff is friendly enough. The elevators are small, slow, and dirty.         

Everywhere in the hotel has filthy, stained carpet and walls. Evidence of human DNA is everywhere. Let your imagination run wild. I did. 

Bathrooms are outdated and gross. Let's talk about the ten person bath tub/shower with ceiling mirror for just a moment. The drain... doesn't. And cleaning those monster tubs can't be easy, so I think they just skip it altogether. Shower shoes are recommended. 

The ceiling mirror above the bed adds another touch of class. Walking around the room in your socks is not a good idea. The dirty carpet will only ruin them. Again, shower shoes.  
                      
The irate drunk male in the hallway shouting F bombs about how unfair his life is at one o'clock in the morning (for about an hour) was nice, but the 8 a.m. construction project on the floor above was really great.

We did not bother going to the pool. Our hearts just weren't in it.

Me and 12 friends booked the party bus expecting a great Vegas club experience. Let me start by saying the hop is a club crawl. Meaning you walk through the casinos to get to the various clubs. 

To start, we met at Mandalay's House of Blues.  The House of Blues was the first stop. We went in for about 15 minutes then walked to the second location which was the Foundation room also located at Mandalay hotel. After that, our tour director (lol) walked us to the third club L.A.X(Luxor).  By then our feet hurt from all the walking so no one went inside the club. We sat outside the club until it was time for the next destination. If we had known this was a club walk, we would have worn walking shoes. 

Following LAX , we finally got on the over booked party bus (There were not enough seat). Luckily two individuals decided to abandon the field trip after walking to LAX. Anyway, the fun began on the bus where we were served watered down premixed drinks. We danced and got a little wild until rain water started leaking into the bus from the overhead emergency exit. The Party host did seem to care that we were getting rained on. 

Due to the rain, we skipped the Vegas sign photo op. 

Finally, the final destination and the end of the hop was the Chateau club located in the Paris hotel. This club was hopping and we partied for a couple  hours.

There were four of us in our party. We ordered a combination of the 3 course special menu and the regular a la carte menu. I had the lobster and truffle risotto which tasted so fishy I could not choke it down. My mom got the oysters Rockefeller which arrived like warm and salty as you can possibly imagine. My husbands butternut squash soup was also like warm and honestly tasted like something out of a Campbell's can (let's face it I've had better Campbell's). I sent mine back and got the mixed green salad instead. That was actually good although not outstanding which is what I expect from this type of restaurant. 

Still trying to be positive we moved on to the next course. Out of 3 dishes bc my husband and dad got the same thing, 2 were sent back. The scallops were gritty, fishy and just plain gross. My mom's swordfish was also fishy and tasted just ""not fresh"" is how I can describe it. The only decent dish was my filet, which I still had to be sent back to have cooked correctly bc my medium came out just plain rare.

We enjoyed the Antipasto for an appetizer. It was delicious! The bean dip was killer! And the bread served was soft and yummy. We split a chicken salad and prosciutto arugula pizza. The salad was fresh, the dressing was perfect and chicken was grilled to perfection. The pizza was yummy, it's crust was soft and doughy. It was a delicious spin off a traditional non-brick oven style pizza. Next time I want to try a pasta dish because it all looked so good and great portions too. This is definitely a restaurant that values using fresh and simple ingredients with nice traditional touches.

We picked what could have been one of the coldest weekends all winter to visit Montreal, but due to the cozy warmth of our home-away-from-home at the Gault we felt so comfortable!  

The room was lovely, we had a loft basic package and really enjoyed the heated floor and cute door overlooking the street.  The bed is super soft and really a nice complement to the modern look of the room.  There's turn down service and cookies provided daily.  The location of the hotel in Old Montreal could not have been better - it's perfect for walking through the area and very close to the waterfront.

We took part in the spa package offered through the website with the Scandinavian baths and really enjoyed the experience.  Our massages were great and the price was reasonable and cheaper than what we would have paid on our own.

I emailed the concierge ahead of time to request a special wine and snack celebratory surprise for my fiance and they were so helpful.  The entire request was provided to perfection and right on time.  I would highly recommend working with the concierge as the recommendations for dinner and jazz club were completely on-point.

Perhaps we are not accustomed to eating BBQ in such quantities, but we hardly made a dent. The variety was very good to sample each of the meats that are offered, as well as two sides. Meats included full rack of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, meat loaf and chicken. We started with the ribs, and while  happy with the portion, I must say that I was disappointed in the meat itself. I'm not sure if they were baby back ribs, but they tasted more like side ribs, and were kind of dry. I am not a BBQ expert, so maybe real BBQ ribs are not supposed to be moist, but if juicy is wrong, then I don't want to be right! The rest of the platter was decent. The sides were probably my favorite part of the meal. We got fries, coleslaw and potato salad. I love sides in general, and all of the sides were excellent. The fries were crispy but not overly crunchy, the coleslaw was creamy and sour, but not too creamy, and the potato salad, topped with some paprika, was one of the best that I've had. There are also two bottles of house BBQ sauce on the table that you can add to your meats; I dumped it in massive amounts all over. The spicy one is pretty good, with some kick but not overbearing. I didn't not try the mild one. 

There are two parts of the meal that are my focus: the sides (as mentioned above), and condiments, including any sauces or little extras that add to the meal. Many times, I can even forgo the main.

Also, we had a billing issue that the waitress and manager could not resolve so she consulted with the owner. Instead of coming over to talk to us, he simple said no and sent her back to us without an explanation. We always try to be gracious to waitstaff when there are problems with the billing because I believe that it is the establishment's responsibility, and so we told her that the bill is wrong but we will pay it to save her the trouble.

I was told that I would have to wait 5 minutes for most of the dishes to come out, so I did. 10 minutes later, I was still waiting. Eventually someone noticed I was still waiting, apologized and offered me a free drink. I ended up getting the orange chicken, walnut shrimp and mandarin beef (crispy beef). The food was not that bad, typical Chinese takeout, but a little healthier. I think that the fried rice was brown rice. Note that the walnut shrimp is considered a premium item and has an additional charge. 

While I don't have complaints about the servers, the manager of the place did act very professionally. With an open kitchen, customers can watch their food being cooked and any interactions in the kitchen. That day, the manager reprimanded one of the cooks; not only did this slow down the food being prepared, but it was unprofessional. As I watched, I felt very bad for the guy; he was only one of two cooks, and from the time that I got there, he was cooking fast and hard.

They have a variety items on their menu but we only tried the tacos - beef tongue, fish and carne asada. All were excellent, full of flavor, and spicy. I like my tacos very spicy, and often times, its not quite spicy enough, but here, the hot sauce really packed some punch. 

The beef tongue was tender and flavorful. The fish taco was fried, the batter was good, not falling off of the fish like many places. The carne asada taco was not as good as the first two, but still enjoyable. All 3 tacos had pico de gallo , carne asada had pickled cabbage. 

My favorite was the beef tongue. I was very apprehensive about it at first, because I've seen raw beef tongue before... its not pretty, but now, I look for restaurants that serve it. I have yet to find one as good.

As we walked in, I was immediately doubtful of my agreeableness. Not only was the restaurant empty, there was an Asian man mopping, and he looked to be the chef. He quickly greeted us, told us to sit anywhere and brought us some hot green tea. At this point I was confused - green tea with pasta? But we went on anyway because he was actually very friendly, and I felt like I just walked into my uncle's house. 

We ordered the butternut squash ravioli and the osso bucco. After ordering, the chef disappeared a while. When he returned, he had two bowls of butternut squash soup and some garlic bread. While it was a little bland, I enjoyed the warm soup on a cold day, and appreciated the complimentary amuse-bouche while we waited. 

Not long after, our mains were served and I must say I was impressed. My SO's osso bucco was accompanied with vegetables and some penne pasta, while my bowl had 4 large ravioli in a rosé sauce, which was perfectly cooked. While I am not a pasta expert, I believe that the ravioli was made fresh and in house. The pasta itself was slightly chewy, with a generous amount of butternut squash in between. The sauce was a little overwhelming but I swept some of it to the side, which the bf gladly soaked up with the garlic bread. The osso bucco was also delicious; the veggies were cooked well, as was the pasta. But the star of the dish was the veal. The marrow was a nice treat to spread on the garlic toast (and on its own), and the meat itself was soft, tender, and well-seasoned. We ended the meal with complimentary tiramisu, which was excellent. 

Overall, Agio has a homey atmosphere, with delicious food. While small and easily missed, it is worth it to give it a try. Don't let the ethnicity of the chef deter you; as others have mentioned, he lived and was trained in Italy for many years.",1,hJulW1s6tOBr2NXD9nAoMQ,0.30000001192092896

Also came with a pickle. 

What really stood out were the fries that came with the combo. I believe that the fries were twice fried with sea salt. I am definitely a fries girl and these were one of the best!

We were quickly seated at the bar, and noticed that there was a strong hot air draft where we were seated. It was very hard to breathe and my eyes were getting dry but this was quickly turned off when the waiter noticed that I was trying to find the source of hot air. Sign of good customer service. 

We ordered a variety of items on the menu including smoked monkfish liver, beef tongue and many different skewers. I really enjoyed the monkfish liver - it was actually my favorite dish of the night. The beef tongue was okay, a little chewy but good flavors. Very smokey. Upon tasting the first skewers that came out, my boyfriend commented on the temperature of the grill, that it wasn't hot enough. While I don't know much about grilling or temperatures, I trust his judgement in this area. As we received the rest of our skewers, each one had more char, and better flavor and texture. 

Of the skewers we ordered, my favorites were the liver, pork cheek, and pork belly. My least favorite was the sasami or chicken tenderloin; I found it a little dry and not enough flavor.

Everything else on the menu was enjoyable, with very good portion sizes - small enough that you have the opportunity to try multiple items. For example, the rolls come in 4's, so you can try more than one roll. Another plus was the dessert.

My cons: 
1. My apartment didn't have a balcony, which I would have loved. ..but I knew that when I signed my lease.
2. After the carpet stains began resurfacing after their pre move in cleaning, it was FILTHY. Def should've been replaced. I couldn't walk barefoot in my own home. And grouping in w the carpet..the cabinets were horribly scratched. .. which only began to show, again, after the pre move in treatment wore off.
3. This is a big one. ... BUGS. When the weather began to heat up, they made their presence known. I know it's Vegas and bugs happen no matter how nice the area . but I HATE them.  *shudders* 
Pros:
1. They spray often and any time you need them to spray indoors, they're there. As well as maintenance. 
2. The area and the neighbors were nice. Very quiet. 
3. Nice, big pool area
4. Different layout. Nice, open space. And I love, LOVE all the windows! I think that was my favorite. I love all the natural light. I didn't have to use any lights til it got dark outside. And the location of my apartment added to all of that. Corner unit w mountain views.

Prior to moving to Arizona, I was affiliated with University hospitals, and saw only physicians I personally knew to be excellent, often leaders in their fields.  However, after moving to AZ awhile back, I did not have the connections or the knowledge of the local health care professionals to afford me this luxury.

I found Dr. Perez to be the epitome of professionalism both in terms of competence and bedside manner.   

His office, internet portal, and staff are all top notch, which I consider secondary to competence and bedside manner, but it sure makes things more pleasant.

I arrived 2 hours early for my appointment due to my own mistake, and I was fit in between patients within 15 minutes.  Despite this, my visit with Dr. Perez was thorough, which is difficult these days given the time restraints primary care physicians often face.

Not sure about the other reviews complaining about support staff and wait times, as my son was seen promptly and the whole office was very professional.  Perhaps these were incidents that transpired secondary to the thoroughness of the diagnostic work up; this is something to applaud not criticize IMHO.  

Some cases are straightforward but others are more complex and you cannot always guarantee a quick 10 minute exam will cure what ails you.  Although this can be frustrating, I'd prefer to have a physician take their time rather than churn through a list of patients to maximize profits and reduce wait times so they can get a better yelp review.  It's your health not a cheeseburger.

When it's your turn, you can be assured that your issue will be addressed properly.

I just moved from MN and my car was overheating. I took my car to the shop and explained the situation. They are very nice but that does not mean that the advice they gave me was right. They played the guessing game with the car looking at the water pump, temp sensor, thermostat, which were all options. They had told me that they had ruled out a blown head gasket, which I was pretty sure was not the issue as I was not leaking coolant anywhere and never needed to fill up.

After being there almost a week they had asked me if they could take it to another shop, but would have to charge me because they were being charged. I agreed and the diagnostic came back as a blown head gasket. I found this odd and they texted me a picture of the diagnostic, which showed that they actually were not charged for the service. They had quoted me that it would be $3,100 to get it fixed, which also seemed really high. I paid the $90 diagnostic and picked my car up 7 days after delivering it.

I was going through a bit of a cash flow problem and limited my driving and washed the temperature. I noticed as the temperature started to cool recently, the car would have to be under extreme stop and go traffic or if I had my a/c on low the temp would rise to the 3/4 mark.

Yesterday I took my car to another guy. He quickly determined a few issues that were causing my problem. He stated the radiator was not operating properly and the radiator fans were working intermittently, as well as they were weak when actually operating. He did this from his house. New radiator, new radiator fan motor, transmission flush, and labor it cost me $550. I put my car through a test today driving around for an hour in stop and go traffic and blasting the a/c...... the problem has been fixed. 

SO the company that did the diagnostic? I thought this was a GM dealership as he had stated, I checked with the 2 dealerships within a few miles of their shop, my car was not taken to either one of them. They also stated that a blown head gasket at their shop would only run about $2,200. That was at a dealership and was $900 cheaper than this place. Plus they did not take it to either dealership, so I am not sure where they took it for the $90 they charged me and of course was a wrong diagnostic.

The trust factor with this place is now gone. I felt I should update my findings as I previously appreciated their due diligence, but now feel a bit ripped off. Thank goodness it only cost me $90 to learn my lesson.

Where to start?  Stayed here on business.  I Booked a King Room with a ""canyon"" view and showed up at the hotel about 10 minutes later since I booked it from the shopping center across the street. 

After waiting almost 20 minutest to check in since there was only 1 person working at the counter at what I'm assuming is the ""peak"" check in time of 445pm, was told there were no King non smoking rooms but they'd be happy to put in in a smoking king... Whatever, give me the queen rooms and no biggie, you'd think.  

The room over looked not a canyon but a beautiful parking structure and the I215 behind it which actually made plenty of noise.  To make matters worse when I pulled the covers back there was so much dust that came off the bed spread it looked like a cloud.

Last straw was getting charged the $30 resort fee and being told they had a ""state of the art fitness center"" included in this, I found the fitness center under renovation and closed.  It was replaced by a conference room with 5 treadmills and TV with no remote control. Seriously?  Fraudulent!!

Store # 6422, Fashion Square Mall, Scottsdale, Arizona.Tonight was the worst experience ever there!  I am a regular Zara Customer having shopped in Chicago, California, and Arizona locations for 8 years now.  This evening, I was shopping in the store for a total of 20 minutes from start to finish.  From the moment I walked trough the door this evening, not one sales associate said a word to me.  No one helped us!  My daughter and I made quick selections for her to try on because we needed something specific, and she headed towards the dressing room.  It was 8:57 at that moment, when the cashier, Maria Marte, was the first person in the entire time I was there to say anything to me.  Here is what she said, ""We are closed.""  I replied, ""Its 3 minutes to closing, you aren't closed yet, my daughter wants to try 3 blouses on, and then we should be able to make a purchase quickly.""  The cashier at Zara, Fashion Square replied to me, ""Well I'm closing my register.""  

At 9:02 pm, the cashier Maria Marte turned to me and said, ""I'm closing my register."".  I said in return, ""We are going to make a purchase, my daughter is finishing up in the dressing room.""  Where in she stated, ""Well we are closed.""  I said, ""You won't let us make a purchase?""  Maria the cashier then said, ""Well my manager said to go ahead and close my register.""  I asked to speak to the store manager, because this didn't seem right. It was no way to treat a customer who is trying to make a purchase at 2 minutes after 9:00 pm

At that moment, the assistant store manager came over to us.  His name is Ruben Sanchez.  Ruben turned to me and said, ""We are closed.""  I said, I realize this, but we are about to make a purchase.  He then said, ""Well our registers are closing.""  I looked at my watch and said, ""It's 4 minutes after, won't you give us some grace and let us make a purchase?""  Ruben the assistant store manager at the Scottsdale, AZ store turned to the cashier and said, ""Close it down.""  Then walked away from me.  I said to Maria the Cashier, ""I come 9 years out of Retail Sales, and have worked for Nordstrom and Barney's New York.  This is never an attitude that a sales associate should have towards a customer that would like to make a purchase.  Generally, at 9:00 pm closing you close the front door, but let any customers still in the store at that time finish out their transaction, make the purchase, then allow them to leave.  This is within a reasonable amount of time, it's 9:06 now.""  Maria the cashier then said, ""Well my manager told me to close the register.""  I replied, ""Even if that means you won't allow me to make a purchase.""  She said, ""Yes.""  After begging them to take my money, I finalized my transaction at 9;06 pm, with purchasing a white blouse my daughter had selected.  I don't think I could ever shop at the Zara Scottsdale, Arizona ever again.  They treated me so meanly and made me feel as though I was being kicked out, when all I was doing was buying a blouse and being a loyal customer.",7,IWGXrVJaQI6QW-_11cqTcw,-0.20000000298023224

I advised that the heaters were on the patio where the delivery technician had placed them the day prior.

Tim Brown, son in law of the owner, was assigned to us.   Tim came out to look at the property and we gave him the plans for the pool that was installed as well as the Plot plan for the house.   We discussed what we wanted with Tim and left to draw an initial plan.   Days later Tim emailed a basic plan and a video of his ideas, So far So Good.   In the meantime we contacted a couple of much larger pool companies, including one that we had used before and has a very good reputation.   Its a good thing we did as the other companies check the codes and found setbacks restrictions that Tim was unaware of.   Due to the research of the other pool companies, we had Tim redraw the plan with those setbacks in mind, as well as some other ideas.   This happened on a number of plan iterations, where another pool company would have a great idea and we would share that idea with Tim to incorporate into our plan.   There were many differences in design quality such as AZ Rainfall uses Alumawood for their Ramadas as opposed to building from scratch like all other builders.   We informed Tim that we would have to check with our association as their rules required similar building materials as the original residence.   All of the sudden I get a call from Tim Brown saying they didn't have the time to send a final plan for approval by the HOA, without which we could not get approval.
It appears that this well over $100,000.00 job was no longer of interest to AZR.   I guess that the demand for pools and landscaping is strong enough that some builders that are not big enough to perform certain jobs find it easier at the last minute to withdraw, having wasted valuable client time.  So if you have a big job, and are a good buyer, you might want to go with a more experienced and larger pool/spa company.",1,MQOibif4l4gX-NzTDQNxGg,0.20000000298023224

When you try to reserve tickets, you can not get the flight you want, you still have to pay the taxes and they request to many points for what the segment is worth.

My other issue is the way the retire points for non activity. This is a punitive and self-service policy. They retired 360,000 miles from my account for non activity but yet they left the account open. I did not get any notice they were going to retire my points. 

I would like to see the appetite for a class action against Aeroplan. Any lawyers want a piece of this? If you had points retired, do you want to join? 

Why do they retire them? There is a financial benefit to the company to steal these points away from their members so the policy is clearly to their benefit and is punitive for their users.

We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10"" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the ""kitchen"" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The ""manager"" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that ""sure bet""!!!  Unfortunately in Anthem the dinning options are very limited and even the Legend Sports Bar (well, sort of a sports bar) is failing as it changes management???  I ordered a pizza there last  week and was told after a 15 minute wait that they had no cheese for the pizza because the whole kitchen/management team just weren't ordering any food?  Wow, what a way to make a transition in business ownership!!! Someone please help these clueless owners/managers!!",0,3PzZdVYJp2o-Fkx5TfcmbQ,-0.4000000059604645

When we first started eating there it was absolutely excellent.  Our last few visits, today and last week were not good at all.  First off the salad bowl used to be filled almost to the top with greens, last two visits there were a good 1 1/2"" from the top (really?) of course the condiments are alwyas put on with a tiny baby spoon, usually not even half full of content, but I get that and am ok with that, but what also doesn't seem right is that if you get a ""large"" size salad, you still get the small size condiments?  Additionally, the honey mustard dressing must have been diluted because it has absolutely no taste and of course was minimally applied.  Another major concern is that while eating the salad, it seemd very gritty, almost like there was sand or dirt on the leaves?  Bad taste as well.  I used to get the lobster bisque but quite ordering that because it seemd that they putting more filler stuff ""celery"" etc. in it and less pieces of lobster.  The Tomato Basil is still very good so that's my go to for soup, assuming we ever go back.
As for customer service?  Spotty at best.  Today the server behind the counter at the soup ask if I wanted any soup, I said yes, a small Tamato Basil.  I got up to the register (very crowded) and there was no soup?  The server of the soup had this blank stare on her face like ""did you want soup""?  Then the cash registers were not working properly and we stood at the counter with our soup getting colder by the minute and 4 to 5 minutes later we finally got to sit and eat.  Only other comment (not a good one) is that the water out of one of the soft drink dispenser tasted very bad?  Not sure why but certainly something to be concerned about.  Well, that's it folks!  We live in Anthem and don't have a lot of great resturants in the ares so we are very sad that this place is seemingly going to hell in a hand basket!!",1,3PzZdVYJp2o-Fkx5TfcmbQ,-0.30000001192092896

They reject the rest of them, claiming things like they ""never heard of those brands"" or ""those are older people brands."" The purchasers have always been very young ladies, probably still in their teens, but I'm still surprised they are unfamiliar with these brands. If they are specifically looking to buy and sell clothing for teens, it seems they should change their marketing to reflect this, because that is not the impression I get from their online presence and store name.

After a minute or two, we were about to leave, when someone came and greeted us.  After that rough start, the service was friendly. They serve complimentary chips and salsa. I did not have any of the salsa, but it looked good. The mahi mahi fish tacos were very good, but be warned that they are spicy.  The Mexican Street Corn is awesome.  I did not care for the fried plantains, but they were prepared fine. I'd just never had plantains before and found that maybe they aren't my thing.

However, I haven't been going to this one lately because of how bad it was the last few times I went. I got chicken nuggets that tasted horrible. How can you ruin chicken nuggets? I got a salad that was significantly smaller than usual and contained wilted lettuce. I don't even think it was the same type of lettuce usually used in that salad. Worst of all, the service wasn't good in the drive-thru, and good service is usually a cornerstone of any Chick-fil-a. The last time I went through the drive-thru was on a weekend. It appeared that only teenagers were working and there were many of them. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but it took forever to get through the drive-thru. I've seen them get two long lines of cars through in no time, but not this time. While I was waiting in the line of cars, I suddenly heard yelling. Apparently two young employees were arguing by the open door between the ordering speaker and the window. I got to listen to that go unchecked for awhile in the slow moving line. When we finally got to the window, there were probably 10 teenagers standing around chatting about their love lives and various other things, but nobody was standing at the window to take my money or give me my order. There was one young lady who was trying to get everyone to work, but she was being ignored. Finally, the one person doing any work got our order together and took my money and gave me my food. After all that, they forgot my honey mustard sauce!

I think more parents and little ones would come to the new location if they would make it easier to enter with a stroller.

First, we were greeted by a young man who kept wondering off, coming back by, saying, ""hold on,"" wondering off again, and then finally seating us in a restaurant that wasn't even particularly crowded. A little unusual, but no big deal so far. A waitress came in a reasonable amount of time and took our drink orders. My ice tea was horrid. It definitely did not taste freshly brewed and had an artificial lemon flavor to it. She took our orders, and brought the children's (burnt) food quickly. Then about 15 minutes later, came back and said they were out of what I had ordered. I found something else to order, and someone eventually brought it along with our other adult meal. Our food was cold when we got it, and of course the kids were done eating by then.  We then didn't see our waitress for about 45 minutes, long after we had finished eating our cold food and were trying to entertain our children who were understandably getting restless at that point.  We were finally able to flag her down and get our bill. I never once saw any sign of management anywhere.

He seems to just wander around doing nothing and not noticing that people aren't being attended to by the servers.  Refills are hard to come by and the delivery of the food is strange.

Pure Barre targets your full body, all the areas that every girl wants to tone up. It's an hour spent working hard to amazing music with WONDERFUL teachers who motivate and inspire you to push yourself past your comfort zone. A nice bonus, ALL the clients that attend the classes are the nicest people which makes for a place you always look forward to coming back to. It's a great workout for anyone. Any age, fitness level, someone who has a lot of dance experience or absolutely none.

The dinning area was claustrophobic and they wouldn't split the check (understandable, but still annoying). Overall, not the best experience.

I usually try and keep it pretty positive when it comes to reviewing restaurants but our experience was the complete opposite of positive and I hope some changes can be made their in the future because their food had some great elements & their owner was nice but other than that....ugh. 

When I mentioned that I am GF and asked if I could get the Chicken Parm but without breadcrumbs (which I would normally not even think to ask for but since they had identified themselves as being willing to accomodate allergies I went ahead and asked), I was told the chef ""is busy and wouldn't want to do that but that he could just put some grilled chicken on top of the pasta but she didn't want to ask him to make it ""parmesan"" style, even though I'm pretty sure that would just consist of putting some sauce and cheese on top.

Well, that leads me to the 2nd issue- the price...$24 for a small pizza (4 small slices) and 6 wings is MUCH MORE than a little on the pricey side.

- The food is DELICIOUS. Even my husband who is the farthest thing from GF or vegan absolutely loved everything we ordered from the raw menu.

- Aesthetically it's beautiful- very posh, well decorated and a pretty relaxing atmosphere. 
- It was easy to locate and had plenty of parking. 
- It was easy to schedule and the staff were all friendly enough. 

However, the thing that brought me to write this review is the quality of the massage I received. While the therapist I saw today was super nice, I honestly feel like I just got oiled rubbed on my skin for an hour. While I can only hope that if I had requested a Deep Tissue massage over the Swedish that it would have been more worth it, honestly- the pressure was non-existent. 

What was even more upsetting to me was that the whole reason I went in for a massage was because I was having some neck issues and made sure to make it known to the therapist before the session began that was what I wanted to focus on...and she basically just did a typical body massage. I've had many massages and that's what she did- no focus on the area /reason I went in there in the first place. And the fact that I paid $70 (not including tip) for this makes me uber regrettful. Sure, I could've complained and tried to direct her movement and pressure but you don't pay that much money to go in there and do that. 

I feel like this place has a lot going for it but I think it would be greatly beneficial for the therapists to do more of a ""consultation"" with the client to see what it is they want exactly and then make sure they stick to that.",5,pTGVqTpsPffvwII5EsGvaw,0.10000000149011612

Why Cure is hands down one of my new favorite restaurants: 
- The atmosphere is great- super rustic, unique, woodsy, creative- they have put intention into every detail and it shows. 
- The salumi plate was SO good; however, while they did great at explaining what each thing was there were so many options that our party didn't know what we were eating at any given time; maybe put little flags in each choice so people can know what they are eating...? 
- The food was DELICIOUS; in our big party we pretty much tried everything on the menu and everyone was blown away. 
- They were great about plating/serving our cupcakes; I was a little put off that they told us (multiple times) that they were going to charge $2 per person to serve the cupcakes, which I find to be a little ridiculous when you're already bringing in a party of 7 with $30 entrees each, but in the end they didn't end up charging us for it.

And, I've got to tell you that the entire evening was terrific!  We chose the full 6 course dinner with wine paring.  Not only was the food fantastic, but the staff could not have been more professional, caring, and just plain terrific.  
There were 8 of us for dinner, yet the kitchen turned out the food on a perfectly timed basis, and was overall an awesome evening.

Entre - Seared Scallops and Spicy Merquez Sausage. More like braised scallops, there was zero caramelizing on them and they were buried underneath, instead of showcasing them.

Crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Great taste and texture. These could become my new food group.

Entrees. For me fish tacos (fried) with house side; for her Combine meatloaf with garlic mash and slaw. Three choices of hot sauce at the ready. I am impressed with this place. Very impressed. My mustard vinagrette was perfect and everything was fresh. Great balance of flavour in the tacos and did I say fresh; as in homemade tortillas fresh. My significant other could not finish her meal, so I rose to the occasion. Amazing meatloaf. If you have never experimented with blending ground meat, you need to try this. Now. Meatloaf, burgers....etc. It adds another level of flavour to the plate and helps maintain moisture. The wrapping of double smoked bacon, just melts in your mouth. 

In a world of poor mega portion platings, (1 kebab and 4 cups of rice) this was spot on and is just what this area needs. Close to transit and great food. It would have been a 5 star if it wasn't for the inquisitive wasp and the noise. We were only 1 of three seatings in the place at the tme and it was LOUD.

Wine: Malbec

This outing was a welcome surprise and our best Winterlicious experience. We were thrilled they had Malbec on the list.

More than enough Calamari for one, could even be shared.

The chicken was fantastic. It was butterflied, but seemed like two breasts. Juicy and very tender. Veg included peppers, green beans, zucchini and turnip. They use seasonal items when available. Everything was cooked perfectly. Nice and tender with just the right amount of crunch on the veg. I can be a fairly big eater, but I was getting full.

It's Saturday and at 12:01 PM, we are already lined up at the Priest. It's cozy, nuff said. The smell is great, just enough to start the salivation process. The fresh meat is nicely formed into balls up, as each serving awaits it's transformation. I chat with some other patrons, it must be my good looks, because others are asking me what this is and what that is. I reply quickly, I am a Burger Priest virgin. I order a double-double for my significant other and 'The Priest"" for myself. Somehow this seems wrong, given my strict catholic upbringing and years as an alter boy. Then my world is shattered. The mushroom fryer is broken. OH THE HUMANITY. So I opt for the double-double and an order of fries. I go for tomatoe, onion and mayo. Let the burger sing it's own song people. It's juicy, the meat flavour is there. Nice crisp on the patty and a minimal bun. It's good, but where are the angels, the path to the white light? Still waiting. Could you and I make these burgers at home? Of course. Is this the holy trinity of meat, bun and add ons, as others have stated? Not in my opnion, or at least not yet. Are they good, absolutely. Eating out is not just about convenience, we are after all, social creatures.

Wie mir Einheimische erzählten war das Ziel, ein ganzes Mittagessen komplett zwischen zwei Scheiben Toast unterzubringen. 
Das ist ja schon sehr praktisch, wenn man Steak, Salat und Fritten direkt auf einmal in sich reinschieben kann und es einem nichts ausmacht, wenn man von einem Ohr bis zum anderen mit dem halben Belag dekoriert ist.
Ich hab mich dann für die Variante 'Tuna' (6.50$) entschieden, was sich allerdings nicht gerade als sinnvoll erwiesen hat. Vielleicht wars der Jetlag oder das leckere Sam Adams, bei Tuna hatte ich an ein Thunfisch gedacht. Nun ja, es war eher eine Thunfischpaste oder sowas, mit Krautsalat, Fritten, Gurken und was weiß ich nicht alles.
Hat eigentlich nur noch die Apfeltorte obendrauf gefehlt.
OK, es war ein sehr lustiger Abend. Das junge Personal hatte auch seinen Spass, als wir das ganze auf Bildern festgehalten hatten.
Restaurant würde ich es nicht nennen. Mit der ganzen Baseball/Basketball Dekoration und den zahllosen TVs an den Wänden, Spielautomatem (und passenderweise gleich dem Geldautomaten daneben) läuft es bei mir eher unter Schnellimbiss.
Auch war man mit der Tischreservierung für 12 Personen schon etwas überfordert.

It was Sunday Brunch and we arrived around 1pm.  The line was loooooong but that was expected.  Once seated at the table, my husband and daughter decided to tackle the ONCE AGAIN LONG LINE at the meat carving station while I decided to tackle the shorter line at the seafood station since I was already starving at this point.   While chowing down on the SUPER SALTY crab legs, I wondered where my husband and daughter were since they still haven't sat down to eat with me.   It nearly took them 30 minutes standing in line at the meat carving station!!  By the time they joined me at the table, I was ready to sample the rest of the food.  I then walked all the way towards the back to the Asian section (by the way the flow of the buffet just doesn't make sense!) to maybe try some sushi or sashimi.   There weren't that many good sushi selections either that's all they has or they just don't replenish fast enough.   I decided to skip the Asian section and walk my way towards the front.  I wanted some cured meats and cheese, but yet again the Parmesan cheese was a whole big block -no shavings or pieces one would have easy access to.  I was looking around for a knife maybe I thought one had to shave the cheese off himself, but no tool was around!  I was really getting frustrated at this point, but I still decided not to give up and try the meat carving station.  I had wishful thinking that the line was going to be shorter this time than when my husband and daughter were here.  Needless to say, the line was not any faster but at this point this was my last resort the last station i want to try since they have Prime Rib - my favorite, so I patiently wait for my turn.  Finally I get Prime Rib with Au Jus on my plate and  FINALLY join my family at the table, to only find out they are ALREADY DONE EATING!  I don't blame them since I was gone for almost 30 minutes!!!   To top it all off, the Au Jus that soaked my Prime Rib was sooo salty that I could only eat 3 bites out of that meat!  I was enraged at this point that I didn't even care to try their desserts!    Not being able to eat at the same time with my family because of the ridiculously long lines at the food stations and to be fed salty dishes is just absurd!   All in all, Bachannal Buffet DOES NOT live up to the hype!   The food is so much better elsewhere!

It literally put me off of Indian food for long time. I did not find the food to be terribly fresh, as though it had been sitting in those chafing dishes for hours. It looked completely unappetizing, and tasted oily and bland. After a few bites I stopped eating.... they certainly got their money's worth out of me considering I ate pennies worth of nan bread and a few bites of food! 

I tried to keep my dining partner good company... he happily ate for 2 and didn't share my sentiments, but I've since spoken with several Montrealers who reassured me that Buffet Maharaja pales in comparison to other Indian restos in the city, upscale (Le Taj, Bombay Palace) and bargain (Bombay Mahal- excellent) alike.

It was extremely frustrating being asked multiple times for the same docs and having my closing date delayed at least twice due delays on their part ( they actually contacted my seller and explained that they were the reason for the closing delay).  The final mixup was on the day of closing when they included impounds in my final payment when a i had clearly requested and  signed documents saying I did not.  They acknowledged the error and  told me the docs would have to go back to underwriting again, thus causing another delay in closing. I knew that my seller would not go for a 3rd delay and I knew I had a good deal on the table.  I was told that the  impounds could possibly be removed during the servicing process, so I accepted the current situation and closed the loan with the mpounds to eliminate my risk.  I was not happy.

I struggle over 30 min on what rating I should grade the Buffet at Wynn Hotel,  I don't know I should put 3 or 4 starts, for sure not 5 stars perfect rating.  Then, I settle with 3-star.  I'd like clarify, it is a 3-star within all the 5-stars hotels competition around in Las Vegas.   If you take about ""general"" rating, it may be 4-star, mainly due to atmosphere and service.    3-star is FOOD only, if good food and variety is what you are looking for.  Not to mention, I have to pay $46 per person to go in.  

Why 3-stars?  I think it failed in 5 main dishes.  1.)  The prime rib and honey-baked ham is too dry.   It almost has no juice in the meat.   2.) Seafood selection is poor, and the sea bass was over cooked.  It was too dry too.   Oyster was so small, and the spinach on top was only at room temperature.  other seafood selection is kind of limited.  I only see King-crab, sea bass, smoked salmon, and oyster.  3.) Asian and Japanese food is SUPER limited too, and doesn't taste very good.   4.) Italian food, so-so.    5.) the juice are not 100% flesh, they are from concentrated formula mixed with a flesh juice.  

Good thing the ""Black pepper backed ham""  save the day, it was cooked carefully, and the meat was carefully selected.  It has a well balance of meat and a little fat to make it juice and smooth.     King crab is not bad.  They pre-cut them in half, making it a lot easier for us to eat.  Good job.  

One thing may worth mention about the choice of drinks.   You have a choice of buffet or buffet with Champagne.   What we didn't know, and our waiter didn't inform us, is that there are actually 3 different type of alcoholic blended drinks are offered with the standard buffet.  So, you have choices not only to soda, juice and coffee (Tea), you have at least 3 other choices (more expensive)... I forgot the name.  I will try to get them next time.

I feel very fortunate that I have tried a lot other 5-stars type of buffet around the world.  before, like Hyatt, Shangri-la, Four Season, Hillton,  Mandalay Bay at LV, Bellagio at LV, Mirage (back in the early 90s) ... etc    So, after having many of experience I had, I think a 3-star for food taste and choice is fair..    

I tried a 2 times in the week.  one for Breakfast / bunch.  One for dinner.  

On the side note, comparing to Wicked Spoon which I tried a few months ago.  I think Wicked Spoon offers more choices on the desert and and salad section..

Good luck on your choice and enjoy your meals.  :-)",0,nza_57QyRMqfVl3zjmTp_g,0.10000000149011612

I waited 15 minutes for the the colorist (Lauren) to greet me and start services.  I asked to speak to the lady who was going to cut my hair.  Everyone was rushed and no-one wanted to take the time to get to know me.  The colorist starting applying the color to my hair and informed me that there was not enough time for my hair cut. If I wanted to get my hair cut, I could come back another day or she could cut my hair.  The rudeness was unbelievable.  I was really looking forward to trying a new salon and stylist.  After much discussion, the manager came over and apologized.  I explained that the cut was the most important part of the day. Because there was not enough time for both, I opted to have the color washed out of my hair and have my hair cut with the person (leah) who I was scheduled with for the cut.  I waited 45 minutes for her, which meant I could have continued with the hair color and been fine with timing.  I came back the next day for Leah to color my hair. She barely said 5 words to me.  I paid $20 more for her to color my hair for a total of $85 for a root touch up.  There was NO offer by the salon for compensation for that fact that I had to come back to the salon TWICE.

There are only two baths, but at the time I went, this was not a problem. There are enough showers and the steam room is big enough, in my opinion. I can't imagine what it would be like if a lot of people came to the sauna. I'd feel a bit cramped for sure .

I asked the employee who cut my hair today to ""read the shape of my head.

The rest of it top portion had some length to it making my head look like it was completely butchered! A cut is suppose to be faded as it moves up to the crown of the head and from there should be well blended. The top of my head looks like a deformity because this person was not paying attention and did not take the time to provide great customer service. A barber should take pride in their work and take their time and know with out a doubt what they are going to do and communicate with the customer so that both parties are on the Same fucking page.

My boyfriend and I have a 5-month old German Shepherd puppy who has been and currently attends training, playtime, and grooming sessions here. 

Training: Matt, the owner of Romp, instructs all the training classes and we could not be happier with his ""training with kindness"" method. There are many ideas about what German Shepherds should be and do act like, but both my boyfriend and I found it truly important to make him the sweetest dog possible. We do not want a robot dog that loses all personality because of training via ""being broken"". Romp exceeds our expectations every time with this regard as, while learning to be obedient for safety and fun, our puppy grows his personality each and every week! It is amazingly spectacular! 

Playtime: Matt's highly professional and super caring staff always make our puppy feel loved and missed every week. It is almost like its his second home here, where all his friends live too. We absolutely love receiving his report cards at the end of each playtime, telling us what his ""paw""sonality, what his favorite activity, who his best friend, and any room of imp""ruff""ment was that day. FYI...he's a straight A student so never any room for imp""ruff""ment here, but the staff will let you know if you need to work on something with your dog. Our puppy adores these play sessions and comes back exhausted from his long day of fun. I do have to say that I always speak to Savanna and she is the best! 

Grooming: Amanda always makes him look so cute! She really does a terrific job and has over 20 years of experience! What more can you ask for than that? Our German Shepherd puppy is extremely unique that loves being clean and looking his best, but tends to oppose being brushed and groomed at home. Somehow, I still do not know how!, Amanda gets him to not only tolerate these activities, but to want to be brushed and groomed all day long! It is so strange, but I am super grateful to her for her sixth sense!

Every where we go and everyone who interacts with our puppy always says how well behaved and what an outstanding temperament he has and it is in huge part due to Matt and his A team at Romp!

All in all, if you have a dog and have not taken him or her to Romp, you are doing a tremendous disservice to yourself and your pup. In other words, you would be crazy not to try this place! I can go on and on. 

Thank you Romp!",3,25L-grqw8r5VqnXYrYxUdQ,0.4000000059604645

I recently had a last-minute move that was uncertain until the very last day. After calling numerous moving companies that all did not have availability for 2 weeks, I received a light at the end of the tunnel by putting faith in One Price Moving. Jeff, the owner, answered all my questions extremely professionally (and, I had many!) and assured me that I would be in good hands. He was completely right! He came to see my possessions that same day so that he could give me a realistic quote to move them. He 100% stuck to the quote given as well as sent over a contract to nail everything down in stone.

For all the little details, from giving me a ton of boxes, arranging for a storage facility just in case, sending over four super impressive movers, and granting all my wishes for the move, it grew to an extraordinary experience. There was not one phone call not answered, question not addressed, and complication not resolved instantly. Additionally, if I was not thrilled enough with Jeff, his skilled movers tipped the scale to having absolutely no doubt that I made the right decision to use One Price Moving. They not only moved, installed, built, hung, and addressed absolutely every item that needed it until all was perfectly in place, but did everything with a smile on their faces and great work ethic. It was an absolute pleasure dealing with this company and I hope that you have the honor of working with them sometime soon too!

She really knows her stuff about hair and is a color correction specialist. Before I moved out to Arizona (originally grew up in NY), my hair was bleach blonde and I never liked it. My hair dresser back in NY LOVED blonde and so kept making my hair lighter with each visit. I did not have the heart to yell at her and say ""stop coloring my hair the color YOU want it to be"". When I met Annie, the experience was ENTIRELY different!!! The first thing she asked me was what I envisioned for my hair color, what I did not like about it, and how I thought it would be perfect. Another thing she said was that anytime I was bored with my hair to feel free to tell her and she would revolutionize it again. She stayed true to her promise in the now two years that I have been seeing her. I also LOVE that if I want something new done to my hair and it is not fashion forward, she will work with the idea until it is. It always comes out even better than the original thought!!! I keep telling her that she needs to start her own product line too so hopefully that is to come soon!!! :D

As far as the vintage portion...Miles runs that. It always has intriguing items that are not what you would expect to find just anywhere. I have personally not made a purchase yet, but my colleague and I went to 3rd Thursday and she bought a door for $5!!! There is not even where to have lunch for that price! Miles gave her helpful suggestions as to how to recreate the door into a unique piece of art with either using pictures and turning it into a giant frame or using it as a room divider. Pretty cool!!!

I had been SO excited to go to this theatre with my boyfriend. I had been telling him for 8 months that we had to go to this theatre because I took the tour, knew about it through work, and just loved the whole idea. My boyfriend is a very ""let's do everything last-minute"" type guy, and so it literally took us that much time to finally get into this theatre for a movie. If you want to go, reserve your spot at least a few days in advance. 

Anyway, we finally got in and saw Jack Ryan. The tickets were NOT worth the money to sit in this ""exclusive"" theatre. We decided to make a full date of the experience and also have dinner at the theatre. My boyfriend's food and soda came about 30 minutes before the movie ended (around 9:00pm) and I was not so lucky, my food and water never arrived!!! My boyfriend and I both asked the waiter several times when my food and water would arrive, when we could find him that is, and nothing! I asked the waiter to at least bring me some water (I was super dehydrated already) and...NOTHING!!! Finally, at the end of the movie, we complained to the waiter and he said he would get a manager. Guess what? A manager NEVER CAME!!! As I told my boyfriend that night, the difference in the comfort of the seats versus a Harkins or AMC is not large enough for me to overlook the extreme disappointment of having to wonder where the waiter is at every moment. I do not even know what happened in the movie!!! That is how preoccupied I got with where the waiter was, where the food was, and if I was even going to have water to drink!!!

I mentioned it, without freaking out obviously - because of course insects are attracted to sugar, but I just thought the staff didn't know.

Otherwise - I love it here. It's not too crazy of a selection, but it's good as far as Calgary and even Canada go for unique sugar selection.

I booked it through Orbitz, where it was listed as a 3-Star hotel and was elated to be getting a great deal... of course it was too good to be true.

The entrance/office was absolutely nothing like the pictures... you sort of had to stretch your imagination to see the semblance from the pictures. 

The rooms were simply drab, complete with hideously patterned sheets and curtains (I can't place what decade they were from). The pillows: imagine a $3.00 Walmart pillow, that has been used 50 times. The room also had an annoying odor, like an old abandoned warehouse. The window A/C unit was one of those from the 1960's (may be not quite that old), with shabby faded wood panelling, and it was plugged into a socket that was falling off the wall. The TV: half the stations were static ridden images. The room was connected to a balcony- (a shared one). But, you guessed it.... you would not want to step into the balcony or leave your dog roaming there... Of course it smelt pretty bad because it was covered in a lime green carpet, that had not been cleaned in maybe 5 years.

And do not be deceived by the free breakfast. I was dreaming of a continental spread with eggs, sausage... Far from it, the fruit basket  contained 20% soft rotting apples, the bread tray- the bread seemed recycled from 3 days (think of the hardened texture of bread that has been left out overnight). Needless to say I was too scared to try the coffee or milk; all I could stomach was the orange juice.

As far as location: The only plus is that it is close to a train stop, with easy access to downtown. Otherwise, there are couple of other motels in the area and nothing else; I mean NOTHING.

Here are the only positives: Thankfully the sheets seemed clean and there were no roaches or rats; the bathroom was decent; and the wireless internet worked.

Please do not fall for this miserable place. I payed $85 for the night and wanted all but 100 pennies back.  I have not stayed in a 1-star motel, but I suspect this place will make some 1-star places look stellar. I know its sort of a harsh review, but it is completely true to my experience there.

I was never very excited about their beer or food, but I love supporting local brewpubs, and I liked the atmosphere. Especially the patio and outdoor bar.
I have a pretty forgiving palate when it comes to craft beer, but Dave's just falls flat. No complexity of flavor in any of the beers, although I haven't tried the stout. They aren't bad, they just have nothing to stand out.
But the reason I decided to write this review is that I was tremendously disappointed during my last visit in early Feb.  Since I work nearby my visits have often included lunch or happy hour food, and I thought they had a decent selection of affordable options. But they removed some of my go-to vegetarian items from the menu.  When I expressed my disappointment, the bartender told me they took the veggie items off because they weren't selling as much.  I can see why a restaurant might stop advertising a item that is not selling.  But there are few replacement options when you start removing vegetarian choices.  In addition, when I asked if they still made the veggie wrap at all, the bartender simply said no.   I hate the thought of being high maintenance, so I didn't press the issue.

Rowing is an incredible total body workout that quickly improves your performance in all athletic activities.  When I finally started running again, I was surprised that I was doing better than before my injury! I would never have stuck with it and developed this appreciation if it wasn't for Morten. I can't imagine a more knowledgeable and devoted rowing coach- an opinion shared by every student I've met in his classes.
Since joining I've added spinning, boot camp and yoga to the list of classes I regularly attend. The schedule is perfect for me (early mornings, but there are evening classes as well) and I always look forward to starting my day with this group. Taking a spin or boot camp class from Linda is fun and inspiring.  She accomplishes an unbelievable amount every day, but nothing ever weakens her contagious passion for fitness.  The community of members is great too, and there are always opportunities to join others for local events like races.

Underwhelming was the chicken pakoras - they were not that great compared to others we have had from at other Hakka places. They were also quite pricy for what you were getting.

This is their newest location. They had been open a few weeks when I visited with a large group of friends. The good news is they were able to accommodate the large party on short notice. The staff were polite, but because it was so busy they were not as attentive as I would have liked. We had to make several requests for garnishes, drinks and cutlery. 

The nightmare came when it came time to order. You had to navigate yourself through the crowds of people to the other side of the restaurant to place your order. They had so many staff around I don't understand why they don't have table service. The nightmare continued when the food took over 45 minutes for everyone to receive their food. Some orders came within 15 minutes, others took up to 45 minutes. By the time the last people received their food the first group of people already finish their dinners. 

I was one of the first ones to receive their dinner but it was cold. The beef was very tough - couldn't stab it with a fork and had to use my hands. The rice was quite bland and the salad wilted. I also tried the butter chicken pizza which was ok. Mixed reviews from the other people we were dining with as well - the grilled chicken was good as was the other barbecued items. some of the other pizzas that they had tried we're also just okay.

This was disappointing. 

First off, it was really awkward sitting on the benches outside on the sidewalk, as people walked past us while to wait for our table. 

Second, when we were seated, it was so loud. It felt like we were in a high school cafeteria. There was so much noise from people talking over each other and from the loud music. We were just happy that we didn't have to share a table with another couple. 

Finally - Food was mediocre. I was extremely disappointed with the curry egg noodle dish. It was awkward to eat and I felt sick about half way through because the curry was too rich. On the flip side - I had a taste of my company's dish and it wasn't that great either - he had the beef stir fry dish with rice. The meat was nice and tender, but it wasn't flavourful.

I'll preface this by saying it was pretty pricey for the whole package, over $100. Mostly in part due to the shave. The experience however, made it all worth it. I don't normally keep a beard, but I had been growing one for the past few months and decided to shave. After the haircut, you get the shave, and it is a process, but it's very in depth, relaxing, and it gives you that feeling of living the good life. 

The haircut is really where I'm on the fence. Although a bad run in with a previous barber unfamiliar with my hair on a work trip left my crown pretty shoddy, my barber, Mignon did good work with what hair I had. Arguably the second best haircut I've ever had, and a picture of the best, she did a very good job. Give it one or two more visits and I'm sure she'll get it dialed in. 

I probably won't get the shave again to save some money, and because I normally stay clean shaven, but if there ever is a time I grow out my beard, I'd get the whole package again simply because it's such a relaxing experience.",0,s2SbRhL14fDSGkQ14k8bFg,0.30000001192092896

The man that shaved my hair cut right across my crown with his clippers and completely ruined it; I didn't have enough hair to comb on it so it sticks straight out of the back of my head and requires an ungodly amount of product to get to lay down, and even then, it'll break free in a few hours.

+ Great location.  Strip mall, not too much traffic.  The storefront faces Baseline, so you can sit in comfort and watch cars go by.

+ The atmosphere is amazing!  I walked in and automatically felt at home.  There are couches, benches, tables, outside seating.  Everything you want in a coffee shop.  There's beautiful photography on the walls (which you can buy), including one of Jared Leto (or at least it looks just like him).  And there are plenty of places to plug in your laptop.

+ Local coffee!! I love it when local shops use homegrown stuff.  I had never had this kind of espresso, but all I can say is that it's damn good.  I can't remember the name, though.

+ The drinks.  Oh. My. Word.  I ordered a cafe mocha with no whip.  It was smooth, creamy, and had just the right amount of mocha.  It was to die for.  Also, if you're a big foam fan, you'll love any of their hot drinks.  I had about an inch of foam in my cup and it was thick and flavorful.

+ The service is just as great as the coffee.  The guy at the counter was polite, helped me choose a good drink, and smiled.  

I must say, it's going to be very difficult for me to find a place better than here.",2,dnSBTYaCnKk_zxjAic1QEQ,0.4000000059604645

On the other hand, I like to think I give pretty fair, intelligent reviews that are well-thought out.   I've been here twice so far.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Hookah is superb.  I will say their stuff is pretty good.  Smooth, not powerful, and flavorful.  

-/+ Customer service.  I think they're decent, but not amazing.  They're nice, friendly, and definitely help you out with any questions you may have.

- EXPENSIVE.  Holy mother of... why would I wanna pay $30 for hookah?  It just really blows my mind how much it costs.  It is good stuff... but really?

-/+ You must order a drink.  I kind of understand how this works on the business side of things, but I think maybe it cuts back on the amount of clientele.  And it's kind of annoying.  I go there for a smoke, not for a drink or coffee.

-/+ Espresso.  It was good, but it didn't make me say, ""Mmmm!""

- Paying for internet.  You must purchase an order of $5 or more to get internet access.  Now, honestly, if you are an internet cafe within walking distance of ASU, you may as well keep the service free. 

+ Computers.  If you are in need of a computer for gaming, do come here.  I play WoW and if I didn't have a decent gaming comp, I would definitely use this place.

After ordering from them for over a year now, I think I have my final consensus. 

Overall, I don't know why I keep coming back to Zella's. I've had some pretty shitty phone service, but I guess I like their food enough to put up with it. PLEASE, if anything, Zella's, learn to be more courteous on the phone!

Please be aware that my review is based only on delivery. (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Good food. I love their boneless wings. Best flavor from any pizza/wing place in Arizona to date (for me). I usually get regular wings because no one likes wimpy wings aka boneless, but I love the Zella's boneless. They've hardly ever messed up my orders, although I'd say the boneless wings can come smaller than normal, and you never know what you'll get. I once got the usual 10, but each ""wing"" was about 1/2"" in size. 

- Waiting. OMG sometimes I wait an hour and a half for my food. Usually they let me know about the wait and are honest with how long it will be, but damn, maybe hire some more people for busy nights? It's been like this since I started ordering from here over a year ago.

-/+ Service. Typically I've had very lousy service on the phone. Twice it was one hour from their closing time and they told me they would not deliver. THIS is what makes me order from a large corporate chain. If they say they close at 9, and you call at 8:45, your order will STILL be delivered. I also had one lady DEMAND my building number (albeit I should know my building number, but no one has ever denied delivery without a building number) and so I hung up and ordered Papa John's. According to her she ""wasn't going to send her driver out there with no building number."" Um, they have to look at the map anyway, get over it. HOWEVER, my delivery service has always had pleasant drivers. One girl even gave me extra ranch (shout out to you, girl!).

+ Prices. For delivery (and usually if it's fried), this place is pretty good. Good portions and I don't spend more than I would at a corporate chain.

-/+ Coupons. Sure, if you want pizza and wings, you can get some good deals. If you want subs or anything else, probably not your best bet. And to my knowledge, their ""deals"" have always been the same.",2,dnSBTYaCnKk_zxjAic1QEQ,0.10000000149011612

-/+ Service is a 50/50.  Some baristas are awesome, some I'd like to slap back into reality.

- Prices suck.  At 3 Roots I tried the pita/veggie plate and it was definitely not worth the nine bucks.  A few slices of carrots, broccoli and celery, a dab of hummus and a stale pita.  Gross.

+ The joint is located on a lake (man-made of course) and it's beautiful.  Once a friend and I passed on the tables and just sat on the edge of the water. Despite the dead fish smell, which wasn't harsh, it was fantastic.

+ The employees always ask how you are doing.  They are quick to make drinks and never get distracted.

+ Wonderful service.  Our waitress was so nice.  She helped me make a decision on my meal and she was very knowledgeable of the menu.  Also, the other employees were happy and spunky.

+ You can add or modify your meal as needed.  A lot of big restaurants (especially more expensive ones) don't allow you do personalize your meal.

+ FOOD.  Oh my goodness.  If you want a meal that is flavorful, cooked right, and unique, you have to try this place.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and it was the best meal I've ever had.  I could taste the different cheeses, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and it melted in my mouth.  My mom ordered a chicken dish and it came with two large chicken breasts and vegetables (she substituted rice for veggies).  Of course, I'm vegetarian and can't eat meat, but the veggies were ridiculous!! They were so delicious.

+ Prices and portions.  Yes, the prices are a tad high, but the portions make it worth it.  I had ten large raviolis stuffed well with mushrooms.  It could easily be split into two meals.

+ Creme brulee.  They have about eight different kinds of creme brulee to choose from.  I ordered the chocolate cake, the original and caramel.  Fantabulous.  Spectacular.
